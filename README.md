**Abstract**:
The overwhelming foreground contamination is one of the primary impediments
to probing the EoR through measuring the redshifted 21 cm signal.
Among various foreground components, radio halos are less studied and their
impacts on the EoR observations are still poorly understood.
In this work, we employ the Press-Schechter formalism, merger-induced turbulent
re-acceleration model, and the latest SKA1-Low layout configuration to simulate
the SKA "observed" images of radio halos.
We calculate the one-dimensional power spectra from simulated images and find
that radio halos can be about 10^4, 10^3, and 10^{2.5} times more luminous
than the EoR signal on scales of 0.1 Mpc^{−1} < k < 2 Mpc^{−1} in the 120–128,
154–162, and 192–200 MHz bands, respectively.
By examining the two-dimensional power spectra inside properly defined EoR
windows, we find that the power leaked by radio halos can still be significant,
as the power ratios of radio halos to the EoR signal on scales of
0.5 Mpc^{−1} ≲ k ≲ 1 Mpc^{−1} can be up to
about 230–800%, 18–95%, and 7–40% in the three bands, when the 68%
uncertainties caused by the variation of the number density of bright radio
halos are considered.
Furthermore, we find that radio halos located inside the far side-lobes of the
station beam can also impose strong contamination within the EoR window.
In conclusion, we argue that radio halos are severe foreground sources and need
serious treatments in future EoR experiments.
