\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%########################################################################
The Epoch of Reionization (EoR; $z \sim \numrange{15}{6}$) refers to
a period of our Universe preceded by the Cosmic Dawn ($z \sim
\numrange{30}{15}$) and the Dark Ages ($z \sim \numrange{200}{30}$)【红移如
此颠倒着写是否正常？？只要有先例，建议自小向大数值写】. During the EoR,
which is expected to last from about 300 million years to about 1 billion
years after the Big Bang, the reionization of neutral hydrogen (\Hi) caused
primarily by the ultra-violet and soft X-ray photons emitted from the first
generation celestial objects efficiently surpassed the cooling of the gas
through recombination of electrons and protons. As a result, the majority of
baryonic matter was again in highly ionized state. Comparing with the
observations of distant quasars and cosmic microwave background (CMB), which
have provided some loose constraints on the reionization process, the
detection of the redshifted 21~cm line emission from \Hi in $\sim 50-200$
MHz, especially those from the adjacent regions of the ionized bubbles, is
recognized to be the decisive tool to directly reveal the EoR
\citep[see][for reviews]{zaroubi2013rev,furlanetto2016rev}.


In order to probe the EoR radio interferometric arries working at the
low-frequency radio bands, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA;
\citealt{mellema2013rev,koopmans2015rev}), the Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array (HERA; \citealt{deboer2017}), and their pathfinders
(e.g., the LOw Frequency ARray or LOFAR - \citealt{vanHaarlem2013}; the
Murchison Widefield Array or MWA - \citealt{bowman2013,tingay2013}; the
Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization or
PAPER - \citealt{parsons2010}; the 21 CentiMeter Array or 21CMA -
\citealt{zheng2016}) have been designed to target the redshifted 21 cm
signals. The challenges met in these experiments, however, are immense due
to a variety of complicated instrumental effects, ionospheric distortion,
artificial radio frequency interference, and the strong celestial foreground
contamination that overwhelms the redshifted 21~cm signals by about
\numrange{4}{5} orders of magnitude
\citep[e.g.,][]{beardsley2016,procopio2017}.


Among various contaminating foreground components, the effects of Galactic
diffuse radiation (including both synchrotron and free-free emissions) and
extragalactic point sources are the most prominent and contribute the
majority of the foreground
\citep[e.g.,][]{shaver1999,diMatteo2004,gleser2008,liu2012,murray2017}. At
\SI{150}{\MHz}, it is estimated that they may account for about
\SI{71}{\percent} and \SI{27}{\percent} of the total foreground,
respectively (ref??). Most of the remaining foreground arises from the
synchrotron emission of the extragalactic diffuse sources that include the
large-scale filaments embedded on the cosmic webs, the intergalactic medium
(IGM) located at the cluster outskirt regions (virial shocks), and the
intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters (radio halos, radio relics, and
mini-halos). Although these sources play a minor role and have been less
constrained by the observations, an appropriate treatment of them is
indispensable in detecting the EoR signals since they may still be tens to
hundreds of times brighter than the redshifted 21~cm signals【此处适当引能够

的话】. 


In this work we address this issue by focusing on the evolution of diffuse
radio halos in galaxy clusters via detailed modeling and its impact on
detecting the EoR signals. First discovered in the Coma cluster (Large et
al. 1959), radio halos have been found in ?? merging and very few relaxed
clusters roughly at their centers, showing relatively regular appearances
and spatial extensions of $\sim$ Mpc in the radio band, as well as an
obvious correlation with the X-ray gas halos (ref??). It should be noted
that the angular sizes of radio halos happen to be several to tens of
arcmins, which coincides those theoretically predicted for the reionizing
bubbles during the EoR. This, complemented with the potentially large number
(several thousands??【全天？？】) of radio halos to be revealed with the
future low-frequency radio arraies (e.g., Cassano et al. 2015), indicates
that in order to better guide foreground removal and avoidance techniques,
it is indispensable to investigate the cumulative effect of radio halos as a
source of the forreground contamination (e.g., Di Matteo et al. 2004??【此文
是关于射电晕干扰的？？】). As of today, however, only few works have been
dedicated to this topic based on relatively straightforward modelings【模型
是否simple？确认！！】 using either radio【或1.4 GHz之类的限定】 flux
functions or radio-X-ray scaling relations, which are constrained by current
observations (e.g., Gleser et al. 2008; Jelic et al. 2008). The data
acquired in these observations have not been complete due to the lack of
systematic surveys with proper instrumentations, especially in the
low-frequency radio band. 
 

The paper is prepared as follows. In \S2 we introduce our new open-source
software \texttt{FG21sim} and use it to simulate the low-frequency radio
sky, in which a detailed simulation of radio halos in galaxy clusters has
been involved by applying the merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration
model. In \S3 we employed the latest SKA1-Low layout configuration to
incorporate the practical instrumental effects into the simulated sky data.
In \S4 we quantitatively evaluate the contamination of radio halos on the
predicted EoR signals and discuss the results, by taking SKA array as an
example. Finally we summarize our work in \5. Throughout this work we adopt
a flat \lcdm{} cosmology with
$H_0 = \SI{100}{\hubble} = \SI{71}{\km\per\second\per\Mpc}$,
$\Omega_m = 0.27$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 1 - \Omega_m = 0.73$,
$\Omega_b = 0.046$, $n_s = 0.96$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.81$.

\section{Simulation of Low-Frequency Radio Sky}
\label{sec:sky-simu}
%########################################################################
Based on our previous works \citep{wang2010,wang2013} we have used the
Python programming language to develop an open-source software (under the
MIT License; \url{https://github.com/liweitianux/fg21sim}), i.e.,
\texttt{FG21sim}, to implement the tasks of simulating the images and
spectra of low-frequency radio sky with high fidelity in optionally selected
frequency intervals. The software is designed to take into account the
contributions of our Galaxy, extragalactic discrete sources (i.e.,
star-forming galaxies, radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
radio-loud AGNs), galaxy clusters, cosmic microwave background (CMB), and 21
cm signals of the EoR【既然是天空仿真，就不要有遗漏！！确认还缺什么！！】,
and it also has an interface to integrate instrumental responses of any
low-frequency radio
interferometers. 


By consulting the latest SKA science book on the EoR survey strategies
\citep[e.g.,][]{koopmans2015rev}, we perform the simulations within
a \SI{8}{\MHz} band/interval?? centered at \SI{158}{\MHz} for a \SI{10 x
10}{\deg}【数字和单位之间需要加空格！！】 sky region at (R.A., Dec.) =
(\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{-27}{\degree}). This region is located at high
galactic latitude ($b = \SI{-78.5}{\degree}$) and passes through the zenith
of SKA1-Low. It has also been observed with MWA (EoR0 field; e.g.,
\citealt{beardsley2016}), which enables us to us actual data to constrain
our simulations. The \SI{8}{\MHz} bandwidth is used to limit the
cosmological evolution effect of the 21~cm signal when calculating the power
spectra \TODO{ref???}, and the large region size is chosen to cover the
first
side-lobe, which helps perform the image cleaning process. The simulated sky
maps are pixelized into \num{1800 x 1800} with a pixel size of
\SI{20}{\arcsec}【与前面的度的符号一致，应用\prime\prime而非arcsec】.

\subsection{Radio Halos in Galaxy Clusters}
\label{sec:cluster-halo}
%========================================================================
As a significant improvement over our past works we consider in detail the
evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters by assuming that relativistic
electrons are re-accelerated in the ICM in merger events via second-order
Fermi acceleration (i.e., the merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration
model), and lose energy via synchrotron emission, inverse Compton scattering
with CMB photons, and inelastic scattering of ?? electrons【请检查】. For
each galaxy cluster, we first build its merging history, which is
quantitatively described by a merger tree, by using the Press-Schechter
formalism of cluster mass function and the extended Press-Schechter theory.
Then we calculate the turbulent acceleration efficiency and duration for
each merger event on the merger tree. By combining the effects of turbulent
acceleration and energy loss, which includes synchrotron emission, inverse
Compton scattering with CMB photons, and inelastic scattering of
low-energy?? electrons【请检查；务必对电子加上限制。能量有多低？最好量化】,
we obtain the time and spatial variations of the relativistic electrons, and
then the evolution of the radio halo.  

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Mass Function}
\label{sec:distributions}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Press-Schechter formalism was originally advanced as one of the standard
method to predict the mass function of galaxy clusters and its evolution in
the Universe \citep{press1974}, and has been extended to combine with the
cold dark matter (CDM) models \citep[e.g.,][]{bond1991,lacey1993}. With this
model, in a unit comoving volume at a certain redshift $z$ and a mass
interval $\rm{d}M$ the number of dark matter halos, or the number of galaxy
clusters in the mass range covered by galaxy clusters【注意：这里结合王婧颖
2010年文p622最后一行左下角处n^CL一式，比较一下。严格地讲，应该是具有质量

度啊，即n(M_CM) = n(M_CL*(1--f_gas))才成立啊！！也就是说，假定暗晕与星系团合
体，其质量分布函数是有一个平移的！！, is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ps-mass-func}
  n(M, z) \,\D{M} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{\langle{\rho}\rangle}{M}
  \frac{\delta_c(z)}{\sigma^2(M)} \left| \diff{\sigma(M)}{M} \right|
  \exp\!\left[ -\frac{\delta_c^2(z)}{2\sigma^2(M)} \right] \D{M},
\end{equation}
where
$M = (1 - f_{\R{gas}}) M_{\R{cl}} = (1 - \Omega_b/\Omega_m) M_{\R{cl}}$
is the dark matter mass ($M_{\R{cl}}$【cl建议改为total】 is the total
gravitating mass, $f_{\R{gas}}$ is the gas fraction, and $\Omega_{b}$ is the
ratio of the baryonic density to the critical density)【检查全文：务必说明每
一个新的符号！！！】, 
$\langle {\rho} \rangle$ is the current mean density of the Universe,
$\delta_c(z)$ is the critical linear overdensity for a region to collapse
at redshift $z$ [see \autoref{eq:delta-crit}],
and $\sigma(M)$ is the current rms (root-mean-square) density fluctuations
within a sphere of mean mass $M$.


Within the frame of the CDM model it is reasonable to adopt the following
power-law distribtuion for the density perturbations
\citep{sarazin2002,randall2002}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sigma-mass}
  \sigma(M) = \sigma_8 \left( \frac{M}{M_8} \right)^{-\alpha},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_8$ is the present-day rms density fluctuations on a
scale of \SI{8}{\per\hubble\Mpc},
$M_8 = (4\pi/3)(8 \,\si{\per\hubble\Mpc})^3 \langle{\rho}\rangle$
is the mass contained in a sphere of a radius \SI{8}{\per\hubble\Mpc},
and the exponent $\alpha = (n+3)/6$ is related to the fluctuations
pattern whose power spectrum varies with wavenumber $k$ as $k^n$.
Following \citet{randall2002} we adopt $n = -7/5$.


Given \autoref{eq:ps-mass-func}, a minimum cluster mass of $M_{\R{min}} =
\SI{e14}{\solarmass}$【注意：这里应是M还是M_total？前者是暗物质，后者才是星
系团的总质量】(ref??), and a maximum redshift of $z_{\R{max}} = 4$ (ref??),
we can determine both the total number and the mass distribution of galaxy
clusters in any given sky patch, and run Monte-Carlo simulations to generate
the galaxy cluster sample with random masses and redshifts【这里可写质量和红
移的符号。但是下标obs不合适。也许应用下标sim】.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Merging History}
\label{sec:merging-history}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
Galaxy clusters are formed hierarchically through accretion and mergers. The
extended Press-Schechter theory outlined in \citet{lacey1993} provide
a way to describe the growth history of a cluster in terms of merger tree.
In order to build the merger tree for each cluster, we start with the
cluster's current mass $M_{\R{obs}}$ and redshift $z_{\R{obs}}$【注意：下标
似应以sim为好】 as randomly sampled in \autoref{sec:distributions}.
We trace the growth history of this cluster back in time by running
Monte Carlo simulations to randomly determine the mass change
$\Delta M$【是否加下标CL？？后面一样，但不再提醒了！！！】 during each
growth step, either a merger event (if $\Delta M > \Delta M_c$) or an
accretion event (if $\Delta M \leq \Delta M_c$). To focus on major mergers
with which radio halos are usually associated, we choose $\Delta M_c =
\SI{e13}{\solarmass}$ (ref??). Similar to ref??, we only trace the merging
history of the main clusters,
the accuracy of which is sufficiently high for this work.


We assume that during each growth step the cluster mass increases from
$M_1$ at time $t_1$ to $M_2$ at $t_2$ ($t_{1} < t_{2}$).
Given $M_2$ and $t_2$, the conditional probability of the cluster had
a progenitor being in the mass range $M_1 \to M_1 + \D{M_1}$ at an
earlier time $t_1$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eps-condprob}
  \R{Pr}(M_1, t_1 | M_2, t_2) \,\D{M_1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
\frac{M_2}{M_1}
  \frac{\delta_{c1} - \delta_{c2}}{(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2)^{3/2}}
  \left| \diff{\sigma_1^2}{M_1} \right|
  \exp \!\left[ -\frac{(\delta_{c1} - \delta_{c2})^2}
    {2(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2)} \right] \D{M_1},
\end{equation}
where
$\delta_{ci} \equiv \delta_c(t_i)$, $\sigma_i \equiv \sigma(M_i)$, and $i =
1, 2$ is used to denote parameters defined at time $t_1$ and $t_2$,
respectively \citep{lacey1993,randall2002}.
By further introducing $S \equiv \sigma^2(M)$ and
$\omega \equiv \delta_c(t)$, the equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eps-condprob-simp}
  \R{Pr}(\Delta S, \Delta \omega) \,\D{\Delta S} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \frac{\Delta\omega}{(\Delta S)^{3/2}}
  \exp \!\left[ -\frac{(\Delta\omega)^2}{2 \Delta S} \right] \D{\Delta S}.
\end{equation}


During the backward tracing of a cluster $\Delta\omega$【前面时间间隔叫做
step。这里的delta似乎不宜称作step】
is chosen adaptively as 
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:dw-step}
  (\Delta\omega)_{\R{step}} \lesssim \frac{1}{2} \left[
    S \left| \diff{\ln \sigma^2}{\ln M} \right|
    \left( \frac{\Delta M_c}{M} \right) \right]^{1/2}
\end{equation}
\citep{randall2002}， where $M$ is the cluster mass at the corresponding
growth step【如果是用了一半的M_CL，应能理解，此句说明就不必要了】, to ???
【公式5具有这个形式必有其意义、目的，可以一句写出来】. Also, at each merger
step the mass change $\Delta S$, or the mass of the subcluster $M_{\rm
sub}$, shall satisfy the distribution
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:cdf-sub-masses}
  \R{Pr}(<\!\Delta S, \Delta\omega) =
  \int_0^{\Delta S} \R{Pr}(\Delta S', \Delta\omega) \,\D{\Delta S'} =
  \erfc \!\left( \frac{\Delta \omega}{\sqrt{2 \Delta S}} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\erfc(x) = 1 - \erf(x)$ is the complementary error function (ref??).
With a random $\Delta S$ (i.e., $M_{\R{sub}}$) drawn from this probability
distribution, the mass of the cluster's progenitor $M_1$ is obtained from
$S_1 = S_2 + \Delta S$【公式右边应是减号吧！！】.


Considering that observable radio halos should be associated with recent
major mergers【高红移的并合实际发生在过去，现在其信号才传到地球。因此，
recent一词似不合适。口语中虽然问题不大，但书面还是慎重。】 and have typical
lifetimes $\tau_{\R{halo}} \lesssim \SI{1}{\Gyr}$ \citep{cassano2016}
\TODO{change ref???}, we trace the cluster merging history to a maximum
backward time of \SI{3}{\Gyr}【此句有误解。读者会以为对各处都以此为溯前界
限。比如，红移的限制在4，那里的信号传到地球需要多少Gyr？？显然超过了。我的理
解是，应写为：对每一处红移，自其信号恰好今天传至地球的时刻，向前追溯3 Gyr】
【因此，此段文句需要进一步修改】.
