\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%########################################################################

The Epoch of Reionization (EoR; $z \sim \numrange{15}{6}$) is a
cosmological periodization referring to a period of our Universe preceded
by the Cosmic Dawn ($z \sim \numrange{30}{15}$) and the Dark Ages
($z \sim \numrange{200}{30}$).
During the EoR, which lasted from about 300 million to 1 billion years
after the Big Bang, the reionization of neutral hydrogen (\Hi) primarily
caused by the ultra-violet and soft X-ray photons from the first
generation celestial objects surpassed the cooling of the gas through
recombination of electrons and protons.
As a result the majority of baryonic matter was again in highly ionized state.
Comparing with the observations of distant quasars and cosmic microwave
background (CMB), which have provided some loose constraints on the
reionization process, the detection the redshifted 21 cm line emission
from \Hi, especially those from the adjacent regions of the ionized bubbles,
is recognized to be the decisive tool to directly reveal this epoch
\citep[see][for reviews]{zaroubi2013rev,furlanetto2016rev}.

In order to probe the EoR, a number of radio interferometric experiments
working at the \SIrange{\sim 100}{200}{\MHz} low-frequency band have been
designed to target the redshifted 21 cm signals.
These include the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR; \citealt{vanHaarlem2013}),
the 21 CentiMeter Array (21CMA; \citealt{zheng2016}),
the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT; \citealt{paciga2011}),
the MIT Epoch of Reionization Experiment (MITEoR; \citealt{zheng2014}),
the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of
Reionization (PAPER; \citealt{parsons2010}),
the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA; \citealt{bowman2013,tingay2013}),
and those to be built and operated in the near future, such as the Square
Kilometre Array (SKA; \citealt{mellema2013rev,koopmans2015rev}) and
the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Arrays (HERA; \citealt{deboer2017}).

The challenges in these EoR experiments, however, are particularly
significant due to a variety of complicated instrumental effects
(e.g., intrinsic chromaticity, direction-dependent response, side lobes,
polarization leakages, noises), ionospheric distortions, radio frequency
interference, and the strong celestial foreground contamination.
For example, the intensity of the cumulative foreground sources, which
is mainly contributed by the diffuse synchrotron radiation from
our Milky Way and is complicated by other components, such as the
non-thermal continuum radiation of numerous extragalactic radio sources,
overwhelms the redshifted 21 cm signals by \numrange{4}{5} orders of
magnitude, indicating that even a sub-percent-level bias in modeling
the foreground is sufficient to impede any attempt to recover the EoR
signals \citep[e.g.,][]{beardsley2016,murray2017,procopio2017}.

A variety of approaches have been proposed to tackle the overwhelming
foreground in order to uncover the EoR signals, and they can be classified
into two broad categories: foreground removal (or subtraction) and
foreground avoidance.
Foreground removal refers to the approaches with which the foreground
components are directly separated from EoR signals by applying appropriate
foreground models.
These approaches can be further divided into two families:
the parametric ones \citep[e.g.,][]{wang2006,jelic2008,liu2009,wang2013}
and the non-parametric ones
\citep[e.g.,][]{harker2009,wang2010,chapman2012,chapman2013,gu2013}.
Foreground avoidance, on the other hand, carries out the EoR analyses
inside the so-called \enquote{EoR window} to avoid the severe foreground
contamination in the 2D cylindrical power spectrum in (\kperp, \klos)
domain, which represent the wavenumbers perpendicular and along the
line of sight, respectively.
In such 2D cylindrical power spectrum, the spectrally smooth foreground
is expected to reside in a well-defined region at small \klos.
The intrinsic chromaticity and other instrumental effects of the
interferometer can throw the angular (i.e., \kperp) foregrounds into
the frequency (i.e., \klos) direction, resulting a wedge-shaped foreground
contaminating region.
Fortunately, an uncontaminated region is expected and dominated by the
EoR signal, defining the \enquote{EoR window}, which has been explored
recently both by simulations
\citep[e.g.,][]{datta2010,thyagarajan2013,thyagarajan2015,barry2016},
by theoretical analyses \citep[e.g.,][]{morales2012,hazelton2013,liu2014},
and by analyzing real observations acquired with, e.g.,
the PAPER \citep{pober2013,ali2015},
the LOFAR \citep{patil2017},
and the MWA \citep{dillon2015,beardsley2016,procopio2017}.

Note, however, that there are advantages and disadvantages for both
approaches
\citep[see][and references therein]{chapman2016}.
For example, foreground removal approaches can keep the information
of EoR at all scales (i.e., all $k$ modes) in the study, but have to
minimize the risk of suffering severe foreground residuals, which is
quite challenging.
Foreground avoidance approaches, on the other hand, deal with the
data free of foreground contamination, but lose a significant part of
the EoR information outside the EoR window.
Also, foreground avoidance strongly depends on the assumption
that the foreground wedge can be well-defined, which may not hold
since the foreground contamination can leak into the EoR window due
to the complicated instrumental and observational effects and
calibration imperfections
\citep[e.g.,][]{barry2016,pober2016,jacobs2016,nunhokee2017}.
Thus the foreground avoidance strategy is by no means optimal, and
removal algorithms are still an active field of research.

In this paper we attempt to investigate the effects of the contamination
contributed by galaxy clusters (in foreground avoidance???), and discuss
how they can be removed safely in the upcoming SKA experiment.
Among various celestial foreground components, the cluster component is
relatively less discussed, although it may contribute about ??\%
\LI{[如何描述星系团的影响程度？]}
of the extragalactic foreground power in $50 - 200$ MHz, where the
EoR signals are expected to appear.
As of today, limited by the insufficient sensitivity and the
small sample (about 100 giant/mini radio halos and 70 radio relics),
the origin of the low frequency radio emission of galaxy clusters,
mostly in the form of synchrotron emission, is still poorly understood.
The task of correctly modeling the radio emission of galaxy clusters
becomes more challenging when we extend our consideration
to either the faint end or higher redshifts ($z \gtrsim 1$).
\TODO{[如何描述星系团的影响？与前面的说明合并？]}
Obviously, if the cumulative contribution of both the low-flux cluster
sources and the residuals caused by inaccurate subtraction of the
bright clusters, which is estimated to be about/at least 2?? orders
of magnitude above the EoR signals, is not properly treated, its contamination
will leak into the EoR window due to the interact with instrumental effects
and calibration issues, which becomes an impediment to detection of EoR
signals \citep[e.g.,][]{datta2010,pober2013,beardsley2016,procopio2017}.

This paper is organized as follows.
In Section~\ref{sec:fg-simu} we describe the details of our new software
\texttt{FG21sim}\footnote{FG21sim: \url{https://github.com/liweitianux/fg21sim}}
(version ???),
which has been developed to simulate the low frequency sky based on the
works of \citet{wang2010,wang2013}.
Comparing to our previous works, the simulations of the Galactic,
and galaxy clusters components have been improved.
In particular, we have significantly enhanced the modeling of galaxy clusters'
emission by applying a merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration model.
Section~\ref{sec:eor-simulation} gives the cosmological EoR signal simulation
using the \texttt{SimFast21}\footnote{SimFast21:
  \url{https://github.com/mariogrs/Simfast21}} (version 20170627)
software \citep{santos2010,hassan2016}.
In Section~??? we model a \SI{10 x 10}{\deg} deep sky
patch among a \SI{8}{\MHz} band centered at \SI{158}{\MHz}, which is
analogous to those will be observed with SKA1-Low
\citep[see][for updated SKA observing strategies]{koopmans2015rev},
with our software \texttt{FG21sim},
(10 deg FoV to consider the first side-lobes)
\TODO{[Sections: EoR signal simulation; observational simulation]}
and input the obtained sky model as well as EoR signals into the
\texttt{OSKAR}\footnote{OSKAR: \url{https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR}}
(version 20170619) with the current available SKA1-Low configuration to
simulate the visibility data sets \citep{mort2010}.
Then we make \enquote{observed} sky images using the
\texttt{WSClean}\footnote{WSClean: \url{https://sourceforge.net/p/wsclean}}
(version 20170528) \citep{offringa2014}, from which the 2D cylindrical
power spectra are calculated by fast Fourier transformation.
In Section~\ref{sec:results} we quantitatively examine to what extent the
EoR window is contaminated by the residuals contributed by mis-subtracted
and un-subtracted galaxy clusters.

We adopt a flat \lcdm{} cosmology throughout this work with
$H_0 = \SI{100}{\hubble} = \SI{71}{\km\per\second\per\Mpc}$,
$\Omega_m = 0.27$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 1 - \Omega_m = 0.73$,
$\Omega_b = 0.046$, $n_s = 0.96$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.81$.

\section{Low-Frequency Sky Simulation With FG21sim}
\label{sec:fg-simu}
%########################################################################

Based on our previous works \citep{wang2010,wang2013}, we have used the Python
programming language to develop the \texttt{FG21sim} software to simulate
the low-frequency radio sky by taking into account the contributions of
Our Galaxy, extragalactic point sources, and galaxy clusters.
The software is public to the community and can be downloaded at
\url{https://github.com/liweitianux/fg21sim},
where technical details (???), a user manual (???), and other auxiliary
data and documents are provided.
Additional tools are also developed to aid the observational simulations
in order to integrate the instrumental responses of low-frequency radio
facilities.
In this work we use \texttt{FG21sim} to simulate sky images and
evaluate the effects of the contamination caused by galaxy clusters.
By consulting the latest SKA science book on the EoR survey strategies
\citep{koopmans2015rev}, we perform the simulations within a \SI{8}{\MHz}
band centered at \SI{158}{\MHz} for a \SI{10 x 10}{\deg} sky region at
(R.A., Dec.) = (\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{-27}{\degree}), which locates at a
high galactic latitude of $b = \SI{-78.5}{\degree}$ and resembles those
that will be observed with SKA1-Low in the future\footnote{This sky region
  is also targeted by MWA (EoR0 field; \citealt{beardsley2016}).}.
Besides the 21 cm signal, we incorporate the Galactic (including both the
synchrotron and free-free emissions) and galaxy cluster foreground components
into the simulated sky maps.
The extragalactic point sources and their contamination are extensively
investigated in the literature, and they can be well modeled and removed
\citep[e.g.,][]{trott2012}, so we leave this component out in this work.
【河外点源略去会有什么影响? 依据是什么? 要做清晰简略的说明，并引用文献;
马、单的论文是否提及??】.
When we model the Galactic contamination, the emission from supernova
remnants (SNRs), some of which may have a large angular size and a
complex morphology, is also neglected because the total number of these
sources is small (about 1000; \citealt{li1991,anderson2017}), and they
prefer to reside in the Galactic disk.
The sky maps are pixelized into \num{1800 x 1800} with a pixel size of
\SI{20}{\arcmin}.


%========================================================================
\subsection{Galactic Synchrotron Emission}
\label{sec:fg-gsync}
%========================================================================

The diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission, the spectrum of which can be
well characterized by a power-law\footnote{We adopt the power-law spectrum
  of form: $S(\nu) \propto \nu^{-\alpha}$.} with
the index $\alpha_{\R{syn}}$ varying with the position in the sky, is the
dominating foreground component in detection of EoR signals.
For example, at about 150 MHz this emission component accounts for about
\SI{99}{\percent} of the Galactic contamination and about \SI{70}{\percent}
of the total foreground intensity \citep{shaver1999,jelic2008}.
To simulate this foreground component we employ the improved
Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} all-sky map\footnote{%
  The 2014 reprocessed Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} map:
  \url{http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/cosmos/haslam_map/}.
  We use the $N_{\R{side}} = 2048$ (i.e., pixel size \SI{\sim 1.72}{\arcmin})
  high resolution map achieved by extrapolating the observed power spectrum
  to small scales.}
provided by \citet{remazeilles2015}, which was obtained by applying
significantly better instrument calibration and more accurate subtraction
of extragalactic sources.
The Galactic synchrotron emission map at lower frequencies is derived
by extrapolating the Haslam template map $T_b^{\R{H408}}(\bm{r})$ as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:gsync-extrap}
  T_b^{\R{syn}}(\bm{r}, \nu) = T_b^{\R{H408}}(\bm{r})
    \left( \frac{\nu}{\SI{408}{\MHz}} \right)^{-\alpha_{\R{syn}}(\bm{r})},
\end{equation}
where $T_b^{\R{syn}}(\bm{r}, \nu)$ is the emission intensity expressed in
brightness temperature at sky position $\bm{r}$ and frequency $\nu$,
and $\alpha_{\R{syn}}(\bm{r}) \sim 2.5-2.9$ is the position-dependent
synchrotron spectral index.
$\alpha_{\R{syn}}(\bm{r})$ is determined by adopting the all-sky
synchrotron spectral index map made by \citet{giardino2002},
which was derived by comparing the Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} all-sky survey
with the northern sky continuum survey at \SI{1420}{\MHz} \citep{reich1986}
and the southern sky survey at \SI{2326}{\MHz} \citep{jonas1998}.


%========================================================================
\subsection{Galactic Free-Free Emission}
\label{sec:fg-gfree}
%========================================================================

Observations of diffuse \Halpha{} and radio recombination line emissions
from both the Galactic plane and high galactic latitudes indicate the
existence of a population of free electrons, which is generated by
processes such as star formation and supernova explosions.
The bremsstrahlung radiation of these free electrons is expected to
contribute about \SI{1}{\percent} of the total Galactic foreground in
\SIrange{100}{200}{\MHz} \citep{shaver1999,jelic2008}.
We improve from our previous work \citep{wang2010} by taking into account
of the dust absorption, and calculate the Galactic free-free emission map
$T_b^{\R{ff}}(\bm{r}, \nu)$ by using the relation given in
\citet{dickinson2003}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halpha-ff}
  T_b^{\R{ff}}(\bm{r}, \nu) = 38.86 \, a(\nu, T_e) \nu^{-2.1}
    10^{(290 / T_e)} \, T_e^{0.667}
    \left[ \frac{I_{\Halpha}^{\R{corr}}(\bm{r})}{\si{\rayleigh}} \right]
    \quad [\si{\kelvin}],
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is the target frequency in units of \si{\MHz}, $T_e$ is the
electron temperature in units of \si{\kelvin}, and the factor
$a(\nu, T_e) = 0.183 \,\nu^{0.1} T_e^{-0.15} [3.91 - \ln \nu + 1.5 \ln T_e]$
is a correction to the optical depth approximation adopted in the derivation.
The $I_{\Halpha}^{\R{corr}}$ is the \Halpha{} intensity corrected for dust
absorption and is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halpha-dust-corr}
  I_{\Halpha}^{\R{corr}}(\bm{r}) = I_{\Halpha}(\bm{r}) \times
    10^{D(\bm{r}) \times 0.0185 \times f_d},
\end{equation}
where $I_{\Halpha}(\bm{r})$ is the observed \Halpha{} intensity at sky
position $\bm{r}$ in units of \si{\rayleigh},
$D(\bm{r})$ is the measured dust column density in units of
[\si{\mega\jansky\per\steradian}],
and $f_d$ is the effective dust fraction along the line of sight.

In this work, we use the all-sky \Halpha{} map from \citet{finkbeiner2003},
the all-sky dust map from \citet{schlegel1998}, and adopt effective dust
fraction $f_d = 0.33$ and electron temperature $T_e = \SI{7000}{\kelvin}$
as suggested by \citet{dickinson2003}.


%========================================================================
\subsection{Galaxy Clusters}
\label{sec:fg-clusters}
%========================================================================

We have significantly improved the model in our previous work \citep{wang2010}
to simulate the contribution of galaxy clusters to the EoR foreground by
taking into account detailed merging history of clusters, which is
established within the frame of the extended Press-Schechter theory
(e.g., \citealt{bond1991,lacey1993}; see also \citealt{press1974}),
and by tracing the evolution of their radio emission via solving the
Fokker-Planck equation for the relativistic electron spectra.

In this work, we employ the merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration
model, the currently most accepted model to explain the origin of giant
radio halos observed in clusters
\citep[see][for recent reviews]{feretti2012rev,brunetti2014rev},
to simulate the energy evolution of relativistic electrons, from which
the synchrotron emission of radio halos is determined.
As for other types of extended emission from galaxy clusters, such as
radio relics and mini-halos, we leave them in the future works due to
their different forming mechanisms.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Dark Matter Halo Distributions}
\label{sec:distributions}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Press-Schechter formalism was originally advanced as one of the standard
method to predict the mass function of galaxy clusters and its evolution
in the Universe \citep{press1974}, and has been extended to combine with
the cold dark matter (CDM) models \citep[e.g.,][]{bond1991,lacey1993}.
The number density (i.e., the number per unit comoving volume per unit
mass) of dark matter halos (i.e., galaxy clusters) at a certain redshift
$z$ is predicted by the Press-Schechter mass function \citep{press1974}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ps-mass-func}
  n(M, z) \,\D{M} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{\langle{\rho}\rangle}{M}
  \frac{\delta_c(z)}{\sigma^2(M)} \left| \diff{\sigma(M)}{M} \right|
  \exp\!\left[ -\frac{\delta_c^2(z)}{2\sigma^2(M)} \right] \D{M},
\end{equation}
where
$M = (1 - \Omega_b/\Omega_m) M_{\R{cluster}}$ is the dark matter halo mass
with $M_{\R{cluster}}$ the cluster mass,
$\langle {\rho} \rangle$ is the current mean density of the Universe,
$\delta_c(z)$ is the critical linear overdensity for a region to collapse
at redshift $z$ [see Equation~(\ref{eq:delta-crit})],
and $\sigma(M)$ is the current rms (root-mean-square) density fluctuations
within a sphere of mean mass $M$.

Considering the CDM model and the halo mass range covered by galaxy
clusters, it is reasonable to adopt such a power-law distribtuion
for the density perturbations \citep{sarazin2002,randall2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sigma-mass}
  \sigma(M) = \sigma_8 \left( \frac{M}{M_8} \right)^{-\alpha},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_8$ is the present-day rms density fluctuations on a
scale of \SI{8}{\per\hubble\Mpc},
$M_8 = (4\pi/3)(8 \,\si{\per\hubble\Mpc})^3 \langle{\rho}\rangle$
is the mass contained in a sphere of a radius \SI{8}{\per\hubble\Mpc},
and the exponent $\alpha = (n+3)/6$ is related to the fluctuations
pattern whose power spectrum varies with wavenumber $k$ as $k^n$.
Here we follow \citep{randall2002} and adopt $n = -7/5$.

Then, by placed a conservative minimum cluster mass cut of
$M_{\R{min}} \simeq \SI{e14}{\solarmass}$ and a maximum redshift cut
at $z_{\R{max}} \simeq 4$, we are able to use Equation~(\ref{eq:ps-mass-func})
to calculate both the total number and the distribution of galaxy
clusters for any given sky patch.
The mass $M_0$, redshift $z_0$, and sky position of each simulated
galaxy cluster can be randomly sampled using the Monte Carlo method
\citep{wang2010}.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Merging History}
\label{sec:merging-history}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

Galaxy clusters are formed hierarchically by accretion and merging from
smaller clusters, groups, and galaxies.
The extended Press-Schechter theory outlined in \citet{lacey1993} provide
us with a way to simulate the growth history of a cluster (i.e., merger tree).
For each merger tree to be built, we start with the cluster's current
mass $M_0$ and redshift $z_0$, which are randomly sampled from the
mass function [Equation~(\ref{eq:ps-mass-func})].
We trace the growth history of this cluster back in time by running
Monte Carlo simulations to randomly determine the mass increase
$\Delta M$ at each step, which may be regarded either as a merger event
(if $\Delta M > \Delta M_c$, where $\Delta M_c = \SI{e12}{\solarmass}$
is the assumed minimum mass change for a merger, i.e., the smallest infalling
sub-cluster to be resolved) or as an accretion event
(if $\Delta M \leq \Delta M_c$).
Whenever a merger event occurs, we also begin to trace the growth history
of the new sub-cluster.

We assume that during each growth step the cluster mass increases from
$M_1$ at time $t_1$ (earlier) to $M_2$ at $t_2$ (later).
Given $M_2$ and $t_2$, the conditional probability of the cluster had
a progenitor being in the mass range $M_1 \to M_1 + \D{M_1}$ at an
earlier time $t_1$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eps-condprob}
  \R{Pr}(M_1, t_1 | M_2, t_2) \,\D{M_1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
\frac{M_2}{M_1}
  \frac{\delta_{c1} - \delta_{c2}}{(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2)^{3/2}}
  \left| \diff{\sigma_1^2}{M_1} \right|
  \exp \!\left[ -\frac{(\delta_{c1} - \delta_{c2})^2}
    {2(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2)} \right] \D{M_1},
\end{equation}
where
$\delta_{ci} \equiv \delta_c(t_i)$, $\sigma_i \equiv \sigma(M_i)$, and $i =
1, 2$ is used to denote parameters defined at time $t_1$ and $t_2$,
respectively \citep{lacey1993,randall2002}.
By further introducing $S \equiv \sigma^2(M)$ and
$\omega \equiv \delta_c(t)$, this equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eps-condprob-simp}
  \R{Pr}(\Delta S, \Delta \omega) \,\D{\Delta S} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \frac{\Delta\omega}{(\Delta S)^{3/2}}
  \exp \!\left[ -\frac{(\Delta\omega)^2}{2 \Delta S} \right] \D{\Delta S}.
\end{equation}

During the backward tracing of a cluster, the step size $\Delta\omega$
is chosen adaptively as \citep{randall2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:dw-step}
  (\Delta\omega)_{\R{step}} \lesssim \frac{1}{2} \left[
    S \left| \diff{\ln \sigma^2}{\ln M} \right|
    \left( \frac{\Delta M_c}{M} \right) \right]^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the cluster mass at the corresponding step.
In order to obey the probability distribution of mergers with different
mass changes (i.e., $\Delta S$),
we sample the cumulative probability distribution of the sub-cluster masses
to determine $\Delta S$ (i.e., $\Delta M$) at each step:
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:cdf-sub-masses}
  \R{Pr}(<\!\Delta S, \Delta\omega) =
  \int_0^{\Delta S} \R{Pr}(\Delta S', \Delta\omega) \,\D{\Delta S'} =
  \erfc \!\left( \frac{\Delta \omega}{\sqrt{2 \Delta S}} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\erfc(x) = 1 - \erf(x)$ is the complementary error function.
With a random $\Delta S$ (i.e., $M_{\R{sub}}$) drawn from this probability
distribution, the mass of the cluster's progenitor $M_1$ is obtained from
$S_1 = S_2 + \Delta S$.

Considering that radio halos are associated to recent major mergers
and have a lifetime $\tau_{\R{halo}}$ much shorter than the
merger-induced disturbance timescale $\tau_m$ (\SIrange{2}{3}{\Gyr})
\citep{cassano2016},
we only trace the merging history of the main cluster
to a maximum backward time of \SI{3}{\Gyr}.
Then for each cluster we identify the most recent major merger
($M_{\R{main}}/M_{\R{sub}} < 5$)
and extract the $(M_{\R{main}}, M_{\R{sub}}, z_{\R{merger}})$
data for use in the following radio halos simulation.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Radio Halos}
\label{sec:halos}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

Giant radio halos in galaxy clusters are associated with the on-going or
most recent major mergers, and they are widely believed to be radiated from
highly relativistic electrons re-accelerated by the merger-induced
large-scale turbulent fluctuations.
In addition, extended radio emissions of smaller scale (a few hundred kpc),
called mini-halos, have been found in some relaxed cool-core clusters.
We do not account for the radio mini-halos for the moment, and they
seems to have a different origin \citep{feretti2012rev}.

The approach we adopted here to simulate the giant radio halos
was largely inspired by \citet{cassano2005}, but we
made various modifications as well as simplifications for our needs.

For each cluster associated with a recent major merger, we assume that
the two sub-clusters undergo only central collisions.
Starting from an initial distance $d_0$ with zero velocity,
the relative impact velocity of two merging clusters with mass
$M_{\R{main}}$ and $M_{\R{sub}}$ upon collision (at a distance
$R_{\R{main}}$ between the centers) is given by
\citep{cassano2005,sarazin2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:v-imp}
  v_{\R{imp}} \simeq \left[
    \frac{2G (M_{\R{main}} + M_{\R{sub}})}{R_{\R{main}}}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\eta_v} \right)\right]^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where $d_0 = \eta_v R_{\R{main}}$,
$\eta_v \simeq 4 (1 + M_{\R{sub}}/M_{\R{main}})^{1/3}$,
and $R_{\R{main}}$ is the virial radius of the main cluster
[see Equation~(\ref{eq:radius-virial})].

Cluster mergers generate turbulence throughout the cluster over
\si{\sim \Mpc} scales.
Energy can be transferred from the ICM into the non-thermal
component through the interactions between electrons and the
magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence, which accelerate the electrons
to be extremely relativistic and radiate synchrotron emissions.
This scenario of particle re-acceleration by turbulence is the most
accepted mechanism responsible for the radio halos \citep{feretti2012rev}.

The turbulence re-acceleration likes a second-order Fermi process, i.e.,
related with a random process, may be effective for only a few
\SI{e8}{\year} during a merger, and thus not quite efficient
\citep{feretti2012rev,ensslin2011}.
We approximate the effective acceleration timescale with the merger
crossing time \citep{cassano2005}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:tau-cross}
  \tau_{\R{cross}} \simeq \frac{R_{\R{main}}}{v_{\R{imp}}},
\end{equation}
which is typically $\lesssim \SI{1}{\Gyr}$.
That means that the merger-induced turbulence is assumed to only accelerate
the electrons from time $t_{\R{merger}}$ (when the merger begins at the
redshift $z_{\R{merger}}$) to $t_{\R{merger}} + \tau_{\R{cross}}$.
In addition, we can estimate the electron acceleration coefficient
according to \citep{cassano2005}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:electron-acc}
  \chi(t) \simeq 6.3 \,\eta_{\R{turb}}
      \left( \frac{M_{\R{main}} + M_{\R{sub}}}{\SI{2e15}{\solarmass}} \right)^{3/2}
      \left( \frac{k_BT}{\SI{7}{\keV}} \right)^{-1/2}
      \left( \frac{R_{\R{halo}}}{\SI{500}{\kpc}} \right)^{-1}
  \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}],
\end{equation}
where $\eta_{\R{turb}}$ is a free parameter roughly describing the fraction
of the turbulence energy transformed into accelerating the electrons (i.e.,
an index of the turbulence acceleration efficiency);
and $k_BT$ and $R_{\R{halo}}$ are the mean temperature of the cluster ICM
and the radio halo radius, respectively, which will be explained later.

The time evolution of relativistic electrons spectrum with isotropic energy
distribution can be derived by solving the Fokker-Planck equation
\citep{eilek1991,schlickeiser2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fokkerplanck}
  \pdiff{n(\gamma,t)}{t} = \pdiff{}{\gamma} \left[ n(\gamma,t) \left(
      \left| \diff{\gamma}{t} \right|_{\R{rad}} +
      \left| \diff{\gamma}{t} \right|_{\R{ion}} -
      \frac{2}{\gamma} D_{\gamma\gamma}(\gamma, t) \right) \right] +
    \pdiff{}{\gamma} \left[ D_{\gamma\gamma} \pdiff{n(\gamma,t)}{\gamma}
    \right] + Q_e(\gamma,t),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma \approx p / (m_e c)$ is the Lorentz factor of the
relativistic electrons with $\gamma \gg 1$,
$n(\gamma, t)$ is the isotropic number density of relativistic
electrons, $Q_e(\gamma, t)$ describes the electron injection,
$|\R{d}\gamma / \R{d}t|_{(\cdot)}$ terms account for the
energy losses due to radiation and ionization,
and $D_{\gamma\gamma}(\gamma, t) = \gamma^2\,\chi(t) / 4$ is the
diffusion coefficient describing the interactions between electrons
and turbulent waves \citep{brunetti2011}.

[REWRITE!]
In some energy ranges (e.g., $\gamma \sim 1000$), the diffusion may
contribute more energies than those lost, therefore can accelerate electrons
to higher energies, making them synchrotron bright.

The electrons that will be re-accelerated \emph{in situ}
by the turbulence permeating the cluster ICM, are thought to be
injected by AGN activities (quasars, radio galaxies, etc.), or by
star formation in normal galaxies (supernovae, galactic winds, etc.)
during the cluster life \citep[see][for a review]{blasi2007rev}.
The electrons can be reasonably assumed to be constantly injected
into the cluster ICM with a power-law spectrum of index $s$
\citep{cassano2005,sarazin1999}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:electron-inj}
  Q_e(\gamma, t) = Q_e(\gamma) = K_e \,\gamma^{-s},
\end{equation}
where $K_e$ is the constant injection rate,
which can be parametrized
by assuming that the total energy injected in the electrons during
the cluster life is a fraction, $\eta_e$, of the total thermal energy
of the cluster \citep{cassano2005}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:injrate-param}
  \epsilon_e \,\tau_{\R{cluster}} \int_{\gamma_{\R{min}}}^{\gamma_{\R{max}}}
  Q_e(\gamma') \gamma' \,\D{\gamma'} \simeq \eta_e \,\epsilon_{\R{th}},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{\R{cluster}} \simeq t_0$ is the cluster age at redshift
$z_0$ as simulated in Section~\ref{sec:distributions},
$\epsilon_e = m_e c^2$ is the energy of one electron at still,
$\epsilon_{\R{th}}$ is the thermal energy density of the cluster ICM,
and $\gamma_{\R{min}} \ll \gamma_{\R{\max}}$ are the minimum and maximum
Lorentz factors of the injected electrons, respectively.
Therefore we derive the electron injection rate to be:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:injrate}
  K_e \simeq \frac{(s-2)\,\eta_e\,\epsilon_{\R{th}}}{\epsilon_e\,\tau_{\R{cluster}}}
    \gamma_{\R{min}}^{s-2}.
\end{equation}

The ICM thermal energy density is calculated as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eth}
  \epsilon_{\R{th}} = \frac{3}{2} \,n_{\R{th}} \,k_B T,
\end{equation}
where $n_{\R{th}}$ is the thermal number density [see Equation~(\ref{eq:nth})],
and $k_B T$ is the ICM mean temperature, which is estimated
from the cluster mass using this $M \!-\! T$ scaling relation
\citep{arnaud2005}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mt-relation}
  \left( \frac{M_{200}}{\SI{e14}{\solarmass}} \right) E(z) = (5.34 \pm 0.22)
  \left( \frac{k_B T}{\SI{5}{\keV}} \right)^{(1.72 \pm 0.10)},
\end{equation}
where $E(z)$ is the redshift evolution factor [see Equation~(\ref{eq:ez-func})].
Note that we approximate the cluster virial mass with $M_{200}$ here.

Observations show that radio halos have a radial size
$R_{\R{halo}} \sim \numrange{3}{6}$ times smaller than the virial radius
$R_{\R{vir}}$, we then estimate the halo radius by
\citep{cassano2007,zandanel2014}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rhalo-rvir}
  R_{\R{halo}} = \frac{1}{4} R_{\R{vir}}.
\end{equation}
The weak \si{\uG}-level magnetic fields are also observed in clusters.
We assume an uniform magnetic field throughout the ICM,
but allow its strength to scale with the cluster mass as \citep{cassano2012}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:magfield-mass}
  B = B_{\langle{M}\rangle} \left( \frac{M}{\langle{M}\rangle} \right)^b,
\end{equation}
where $\langle {M} \rangle = \SI{1.6e15}{\solarmass}$, and we take
$B_{\langle {M} \rangle} = \SI{1.9}{\uG}$ and $b = 1.5$ in this work
as suggested by \citet{cassano2006}.

On the other hand,
relativistic electrons lose energy via synchrotron radiation
and inverse Compton scattering off the CMB photons \citep{sarazin1999}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eloss-rad}
  \left( \diff{\gamma}{t} \right)_{\R{rad}} =
  \num{-4.32e-4} \,\gamma^2
  \left[ \left( \frac{B}{\SI{3.25}{\uG}} \right)^2 +
  (1+z)^4 \right] \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}],
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the magnetic field strength in the ICM.
Meanwhile, electrons in the ICM also lose energy through
ionization and Coulomb collisions \citep{sarazin1999}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eloss-ion}
  \left( \diff{\gamma}{t} \right)_{\R{ion}} =
  \num{-3.79e4} \,n_{\R{th}} \left[ 1 +
    \frac{\ln(\gamma/n_{\R{th}})}{75} \right] \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}],
\end{equation}
with $n_{\R{th}}$ in units of \si{\per\cm\cubed}.

Having all the coefficients of the Fokker-Planck
equation~(\ref{eq:fokkerplanck}) been determined, we can now derive
the time evolution of the electron spectrum.
An efficient numerical method proposed by \citet{chang1970} is
utilized to solve the Fokker-Planck equation, under the no-flux boundary
condition \citep{park1996}.
However, to avoid unphysical pile-up of electrons at the lower boundary,
we define a \enquote{buffer} region below $\gamma_{\R{buf}}$, within which
the spectrum are replaced by extrapolating as a power law, based on
the spectrum above $\gamma_{\R{buf}}$ \citep{donnert2014}.
We adopt a logarithmic grid for $\gamma \in [1, 10^5]$ with 200 cells,
and let the lower buffer region span 10 cells.

We solve the Fokker-Planck equation from the time $t_{\R{merger}}$
(i.e., $z_{\R{merger}}$) when the identified major merger begins,
until to the time $t_0$ (i.e., $z_0$) which corresponds to the current
time of our simulated \enquote{observations.}
The low-energy electrons (e.g., $\gamma \sim 300$) have very long
lifetimes, they may be accumulated and retained as the cluster
grows \citep{sarazin1999}.
We therefore estimate the initial electron spectrum at $t_{\R{merger}}$ as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ne-init}
  n(\gamma, t=t_{\R{merger}}) = t_{\R{merger}} K_e \,\gamma^{-s}.
\end{equation}

Once the current electron spectrum $n(\gamma, t_0)$ been derived,
the synchrotron emissivity in units of
[\si{\erg\per\second\per\cm\cubed\per\hertz}],
is determined by \citep{rybicki1979}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:jnu-sync}
  J_{\R{syn}}(\nu, t_0) = \frac{\sqrt{3} \, e^3 B}{m_e c^2}
  \int_{\gamma_{\R{min}}}^{\gamma_{\R{max}}} \!\!\int_0^{\pi/2}
  n(\gamma, t_0) F\!\left( \frac{\nu}{\nu_c} \right) \sin^2 \!\theta
  \,\D{\theta} \,\D{\gamma},
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the pitch angle of the electron,
and $F(\nu/\nu_c)$ is the synchrotron kernel:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sync-kernel}
  F\!\left( \frac{\nu}{\nu_c} \right) = \frac{\nu}{\nu_c}
  \int_{\nu/\nu_c}^{\infty} K_{5/3}(x) \,\D{x},
\end{equation}
with $K_{5/3}(x)$ the modified Bessel function of order 5/3,
$\nu_c = (3/2) \,\gamma^2 \nu_L \sin\theta$ the critical frequency,
and $\nu_L = e B / (2\pi m_e c)$ the Larmor frequency of electrons.

The synchrotron emissivity is the same throughout the radio halo,
according to our previous assumptions, we can then calculate the radio
power at a specific frequency (i.e., spectral luminosity) as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-power}
  P_{\nu} \equiv P(\nu) = \frac{4\pi}{3} R_{\R{halo}}^3 J_{\R{syn}}(\nu),
\end{equation}
and the halo flux density $S_{\nu}$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-flux-density}
  S_{\nu} = \frac{P_{\nu}}{4\pi D_L^2},
\end{equation}
where $D_L$ is the luminosity distance to the halo at redshift $z_0$.
We adopt the exponential profile for the azimuthally averaged brightness
distribution of radio halos, which is expressed as \citep{murgia2009}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-exprofile}
  I_{\nu}(\theta) = I_{\nu,0} \exp(-\theta/\theta_e),
\end{equation}
where $\theta = R / D_A$ is the angular radius from the halo center,
with $D_A$ the angular diameter distance to the halo,
$\theta_e = \theta_{\R{halo}}/3$ is the $e$-folding radius,
and $I_{\nu,0}$ is the central brightness, which is constrained by the
above flux density $S_{\nu}$ and can be derived to be:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:central-brightness}
  I_{\nu,0} = \frac{S_{\nu}}{2\pi \,\theta_e^2}.
\end{equation}

Finally, we simulate the appearance of each radio halo as an ellipse by
randomly assigning an ellipticity $f_e$ and a rotation angle $\phi$,
and then superimpose all the halo images to the sky patch to obtain the
simulated images of radio halos at each frequency of interest.

\section{EoR Signal Simulation}
\label{sec:eor-simulation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We simulate the cosmological EoR signal using the \texttt{SimFast21}
(version 20170627) software, which can perform fast simulations to the
\Hi{} \SI{21}{\cm} signal during and prior to the EoR by utilizing a
semi-numerical scheme \citep{santos2010,hassan2016}.
\texttt{SimFast21} generates 3D realizations of the dark matter density
fields and models their evolution to determine the collapsed dark matter
halos using an excursion-set algorithm, then derives the ionizing sources
and their time evolution, from which the final brightness temperature of
the \SI{21}{\cm} signal is obtained \citep{santos2010}.

In this work, we simulated a cube of \SI{500}{\cMpc} (comoving \si{\Mpc})
and 500 cells along each side.  \texttt{SimFast21} performed the
simulation from redshift $z=9$ to $z=7$ with a step of $\Delta z = 0.1$,
and produced a set of so-called \enquote{coeval cubes} containing the
\SI{21}{\cm} signal brightness temperature distribution at a single
look-back time (i.e., same cosmological redshift) for each of them.
These simulated coeval cubes cannot been observed in practice, but the
observable \enquote{light-cone cube} can be created from them using the
method outlined by \citet{datta2012}.
From the light-cone cube, we extract the brightness temperature slices
at requested frequencies by interpolating along the comoving distance
(i.e., redshift).
We note that these extracted slices only have an angular size of
\SI{\sim 3}{\deg} (observed at \SI{158}{\MHz}), which is much smaller
than our needs.  Therefore, we tile and re-scale these slices to make
them have the same angular and image sizes as our foreground maps.


%########################################################################
\section{Observational Simulation}
\label{sec:obs-simulation}
%########################################################################

To investigate the practical contamination in the EoR window due to the
galaxy clusters, we need to simulate the \enquote{observed} images of
the above simulated foreground sky and EoR signal.
For this purpose,
we adopt the latest SKA1-Low layout configuration\footnote{%
  SKA-TEL-SKO-0000422: SKA1-low Configuration Coordinates: \url{https://astronomers.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SKA-TEL-SKO-0000422_02_SKA1_LowConfigurationCoordinates-1.pdf}}
released on 2016 May 21.
The SKA1-Low interferometer consists of 512 stations, with 224 of them
randomly distributed within the \enquote{core} of \SI{1000}{\meter} in
diameter, while rest of the stations are grouped into \enquote{clusters}
and arranged on 3 spiral arms extending up to a radius of
\SI{\sim 35}{\kilo\meter}.
Each station has 256 antennas randomly distributed with a minimum separation
of $d_{\R{min}} = \SI{1.5}{\meter}$ inside a circular region of
\SI{35}{\meter} in diameter.
With this layout configuration, the dense core makes the SKA1-Low very
sensitive to the EoR signal, while the long baselines greatly help the
foreground characterization and removal, as well as other scientific goals.
For example, at \SI{158}{\MHz}, the SKA1-Low has a FoV of
\SI{\sim 4 x 4}{\deg}, and angular resolution of \SI{\sim 7}{\arcsec}.

Both the observational simulation and imaging are very computational
intensive, but our computing resources are rather limited, so we can
only choose a set of conservative parameters.
The \SIrange{154}{162}{\MHz} band of our interest is divided into 51
channels with a frequency channel width of \SI{160}{\kilo\hertz}.
The sky maps simulated in previous sections are centered at (R.A., Dec.)
= (\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{-27}{\degree}), such that the observing field
will pass through the zenith of the interferometer, and this position
is also the center of the \enquote{EoR0} field identified by the MWA
\citep{beardsley2016}.
At each frequency channel, the sky map is tapered by a Tukey window
function to suppress the side-lobe impacts, and then input into the
\texttt{OSKAR} simulator \citep{mort2010} to perform the observation
for \SI{6}{\hour} ($\pm \SI{3}{\hour}$ in Hour Angle) with a time
averaging step of \SI{5}{\minute}.

The simulated visibility data at each frequency channel are combined
to create the \enquote{observed} image cube using the \texttt{WSClean}
imager \citep{offringa2014} with Briggs weighting and joined-channel
deconvolution \citep{offringa2017}.
Finally, we crop out the central \SI{4 x 4}{\deg} to create the 2D
cylindrical and 1D spherical power spectra.

    Take the above simulated image cube, subtract the spectral-smooth
    foregrounds fitting a smooth polynomial along the frequency axis,
    evaluate the loss of EoR signals (use image-domain indexes???
    can also use the total power spectrum???)

    May consider two cases: (1) only radio halos is superimposed onto the
    EoR signals; (2) radio halos as well as Galactic foregrounds are
    added to the EoR signals.

  \item[Power spectrum]
    Take the above simulated image cube, calculate the 2D
    (i.e., cylindrically averaged) power spectrum, evaluate the foregrounds
    contamination within the (theoretically predicted) EoR window,
    compare to the case that only EoR signals exist in the EoR windows.

\NOTE{Current limitations???}

%% TODO: future works/improvements:
One of the main purposes of our foregrounds simulation is to support
the development and evaluation of foregrounds removal or separation
methods in our forthcoming works.
We will combine our foregrounds simulation with interferometric
observational simulation, to generate the \enquote{observed} visibility
data as well as images (e.g., by using the \textsc{clean} algorithm).
In this way, we incorporate the realistic instrumental effects into
our simulation pipeline, making our developed methods more versatile
and prepare for future real observations.
(\NOTE{Move this paragraph to above simulation section?})

In addition to the foregrounds removal aiming at the EoR signal
detection, the methods to effectively identify and extract the faint
extended radio emissions (e.g., halos, relics) from observation images
is of the same importance.
With future more sensitive observations combined with a better detection
method, we are able to build a big sample of galaxy clusters, which
may provide us with plenty of opportunities to study them in the radio
regime.

Moreover, there is still much room to improve the current foregrounds
simulation, e.g., taking radio relics into account, more realistic
source morphologies by utilizing the deep learning techniques,
full polarization support.
We will continue to improve our foregrounds simulation works and make
them available in our public software \texttt{fg21sim} in the future.

In addition, galaxy clusters are also important objects of study in their
own right:
\LI{[需增强/突出]}
\begin{itemize}
  \item elements to form the large-scale structures, key to understand the
    structure formation and evolution of the Universe;
  \item merger-induced turbulence and shocks accelerate electrons to produce
    extended halos and relics, respectively, enable us to trace cluster
    mergers and formations with radio techniques;
  \item great laboratory to study the origin of cosmic rays, particle
    acceleration, magnetic growth and distribution, etc.
\end{itemize}

Due to their low surface brightness and steep spectra, these extended
radio emissions from galaxy clusters are difficult to find at middle-
or high-frequency ranges (e.g., \SI{1.4}{\GHz}).
However, they become much brighter and thus easier to be detected in
the low-frequency radio band.  The large field of view (FoV) of the
low-frequency interferometer also helps discover them more efficiently.
Owing to its excellent sensitivity, the SKA will possibly discover more
than several thousands of halos and relics, providing us with invaluable
data to understand and solve the puzzles with regard to galaxy clusters.
Furthermore, the faint radio sky can be very different, and we may have
unexpected findings as we go deeper \citep{padovani2016rev,herreraRuiz2017}.

\section{Useful Formulas}
\label{sec:formulas}

In this section we collect some useful formulas we made use of in our
simulations.

The Hubble parameter at redshift $z$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hubble-z}
  H(z) = H_0 E(z),
\end{equation}
where $H_0$ is the present-day Hubble value,
and $E(z)$ is the redshift evolution factor given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ez-func}
  E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}}.
\end{equation}
(Note that we adopt a flat \lcdm{} cosmology so that
$\Omega_k = 1 - \Omega_m - \Omega_{\Lambda} = 0$.)

The critical density of the Universe at redshift $z$ is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:rho-crit}
  \rho_{\R{crit}}(z) = \frac{3 H^2(z)}{8 \pi G},
\end{equation}
where $G$ is the gravitational constant.

On the other hand, the critical linear overdensity as a function of
redshift $z$ is \citep{kitayama1996,randall2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-crit}
  \delta_c(z) = \frac{D(z=0)}{D(z)}
  \left[ \frac{3 (12\pi)^{2/3}}{20} \right]
  \left[1 + 0.0123 \log_{10} \Omega_f(z) \right],
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_f(z)$ is the mass density ratio at redshift $z$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:omega-fz}
  \Omega_f(z) = \frac{\Omega_m(1+z)^3}{\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}},
\end{equation}
and $D(z)$ is the growth factor given by
\citep[Equation~(13.6)]{peebles1980}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth-factor}
  D(x) = \frac{(x^3 + 2)^{1/2}}{x^{3/2}}
    \int_0^x y^{3/2} (y^3 + 2)^{-3/2} \,\D{y},
\end{equation}
with $x_0 \equiv (2\Omega_{\Lambda}/\Omega_m)^{1/3}$ and
$x = x_0 / (1+z)$.

The virial radius of a cluster is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:radius-virial}
  R_{\R{vir}} = \left[
    \frac{3 M_{\R{vir}}}{4\pi \Delta_{\R{vir}}(z) \rho_{\R{crit}}(z)}
  \right]^{1/3},
\end{equation}
where $M_{\R{vir}}$ is the virial mass (can also be regarded as
the total mass) of the cluster,
$\rho_{\R{crit}}(z)$ is the critical density at redshift $z$,
and $\Delta_{\R{vir}}(z)$ is the average overdensity of the cluster
at redshift $z$ given by \citep{kitayama1996,cassano2005}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-vir}
  \Delta_{\R{vir}}(z) = 18\pi^2 \left[ 1 + 0.4093 \, w(z)^{0.9052} \right],
\end{equation}
where $w(z) \equiv \Omega_f^{-1}(z) - 1$.

The thermal number density of the cluster ICM is approximately given by:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:nth}
  n_{\R{th}} \simeq
    \frac{3 M_{\R{baryon}}}{4\pi \mu m_u R_{\R{vir}}^3},
\end{equation}
where $\mu \simeq 0.6$ is the mean molecular weight \citep{ettori2013},
$m_u$ is the atomic mass unit,
and $M_{\R{baryon}} \simeq M_{\R{vir}} f_b$ is the baryon mass
of the cluster with $f_b \simeq \Omega_b / \Omega_m$ the mean baryon
fraction assumed for clusters.

In a flat \lcdm{} cosmology as we adopted, the age of the Universe
at redshift $z$ takes an analytical form
\citep[their Equation~(18)]{thomas2000}:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:universe-age}
  t(z; \Omega_m, \Omega_{\Lambda}=1-\Omega_m)
    & = \frac{1}{H_0} \int_z^{\infty}
      \frac{\D{z'}}{(1+z')\sqrt{1 + \Omega_m z' (3+3z'+z'^2)}} \nonumber \\
    & = \frac{2}{3 H_0 \sqrt{1-\Omega_m}} \sinh^{-1} \!\left(
      \sqrt{\frac{\Omega_m^{-1} - 1}{(1+z)^3}} \right).
\end{align}
This formula can also be inverted analytically to derive the redshift
$z$ corresponding to a cosmic time $t$ (i.e., age of the Universe),
which is used in our building of cluster merger trees
in Section~\ref{sec:merging-history}.

The \emph{angular diameter distance} $D_A$ is defined as the ratio of
an object's physical transverse size to its (observed) angular size
(in radians).  Note that it does \emph{not} increases indefinitely
as $z \to \infty$, therefore more distant (e.g., $z > 1$)
objects of same physical size may actually appear larger!
The angular diameter distance is used to convert the observed angular
separations between sources into their proper separations, and it is
related to the \emph{transverse comoving distance} $D_M$ by
\citep{weinberg1972,peebles1993,hogg1999}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:da-dm}
  D_A(z) = \frac{D_M(z)}{1 + z}.
\end{equation}

The \emph{luminosity distance} $D_L$ is defined by the relationship
between the measured bolometric (i.e., integrated over all frequencies)
flux $S_{\R{bolo}}$ and the object's intrinsic bolometric luminosity
$L_{\R{bolo}}$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dl-def}
  D_L \equiv \sqrt{\frac{L_{\R{bolo}}}{4\pi S_{\R{bolo}}}}.
\end{equation}
And it is related to the transverse comoving distance and angular
diameter distance by \citep{weinberg1972,hogg1999,ellis2007}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dl-dm-da}
  D_L(z) = (1+z) D_M(z) = (1+z)^2 D_A(z).
\end{equation}

In the radio frequency regime, the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation
always holds, therefore the spectral brightness $I_{\nu}$ can be
equivalently expressed by \emph{brightness temperature} $T_b(\nu)$
through the relation \citep{condon2016}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:brightness-temp}
  T_b(\nu) \equiv \frac{I_{\nu} c^2}{2 k_B \nu^2}.
\end{equation}
