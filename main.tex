\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%########################################################################

{\color{magenta}
The Epoch of Reionization (EoR; $z \sim \numrange{6}{15}$) refers to
a period of our Universe preceded
by the Cosmic Dawn ($z \sim \numrange{15}{30}$) and the Dark Ages
($z \sim \numrange{30}{200}$).
}
During the EoR, which is expected to last from about 300 million to
about 1 billion years after the Big Bang, the reionization of
neutral hydrogen (\Hi) caused primarily by the ultra-violet and soft
X-ray photons emitted from the first generation celestial objects
efficiently surpassed the cooling of the gas through
recombination of electrons and protons.
As a result, the majority of baryonic matter was again in a
highly ionized state.
Comparing with the observations of distant quasars and cosmic microwave
background (CMB), which have provided some loose constraints on the
reionization process, the detection the redshifted 21~cm line emission
from \Hi{} in \SIrange{\sim 50}{200}{\MHz}, especially those from the
adjacent regions of the ionized bubbles,
is recognized to be the decisive tool to directly reveal the EoR
\citep[see][for reviews]{zaroubi2013rev,furlanetto2016rev}.

In order to probe the EoR, a number of radio interferometers
working at the low-frequency radio bands, such as
the Square Kilometre Array (SKA; \citealt{mellema2013rev,koopmans2015rev}),
the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA; \citealt{deboer2017}),
{\color{magenta}
and their pathfinders [e.g.,
the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR; \citealt{vanHaarlem2013});
the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA; \citealt{bowman2013,tingay2013});
the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization
(PAPER; \citealt{parsons2010});
the 21 CentiMeter Array (21CMA; \citealt{zheng2016})]
}
have been designed to target the redshifted 21~cm signals.
The challenges met in these experiments, however, are immense
due to a variety of complicated instrumental effects,
ionospheric distortions, radio frequency interference, and the
strong celestial foreground contamination, which overwhelms the
redshifted 21~cm signals by \numrange{4}{5} orders of magnitude
\citep[see][for a review]{morales2010rev}.

Among various contaminating foreground components, the Galactic diffuse
radiation (including both the synchrotron and free-free emissions)
and extragalactic point sources are the most prominent and contribute
the majority of the foreground
\citep[e.g.,][]{shaver1999,diMatteo2004,gleser2008,liu2012,murray2017}.
At about \SI{150}{\MHz}, it is estimated that they may account for
about \SI{71}{\percent} and \SI{27}{\percent} of the total foreground,
respectively \citep{shaver1999}.
Most of the remaining foreground arises from the synchrotron emission
from the extragalactic diffuse sources that include the large-scale
filaments embedded in the cosmic webs,
the intergalactic medium located at the cluster outskirts (virial shocks),
and the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters (radio halos,
radio relics, and mini-halos).
Although these sources play a minor role and have been less constrained
by observations, an appropriate treatment of them is indispensable
in detecting the very faint EoR signals, since they may still be
{\color{magenta}
tens to hundreds of times brighter than the target signals
\citep[e.g.,][]{waxman2000,diMatteo2004,gleser2008}.
As estimated in \citet{diMatteo2004}, the intensity fluctuation
at \SI{115}{\MHz} contributed by extended radio halos and relics
is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of 21~cm signals
through the whole range of angular scales.
}

In this work, we attempt to address this issue by focusing on the
evolution of diffuse radio halos in galaxy clusters via detailed
modeling and their impacts on detecting the EoR signals.
First discovered in the Coma cluster \citep{large1959}, radio halos
has been observed in about 80 merging galaxy clusters roughly at
their centers, showing relatively regular morphologies and spatial
extensions of $\sim\,$\si{\Mpc}, as well as an obvious correlation
with the X-ray-emitting ICM \citep[e.g.,][]{cassano2013}.
It should be noted that the angular sizes of radio halos happen to be
several to tens of arcminutes, which coincides with those theoretically
predicted for the ionizing bubbles during the EoR.
This, complemented with the potentially large number
{\color{magenta}(several to tens of thousand in all sky)}
of radio halos to be revealed by the forthcoming
low-frequency radio telescopes \citep[e.g.,][]{cassano2015},
indicates that in order to better guide foreground removal and avoidance
techniques, it is essential to investigate the cumulative emission
of radio halos as a source of the foreground contamination
\citep[e.g.,][]{diMatteo2004,gleser2008}
\XU{Di Matteo et al. 2004 一文是关于射电晕干扰的？？}
\LI{此文研究了河外展源，主要是射电晕和射电遗迹；
但该文章比较旧了，有些方法和结果现在已经有点不适用了}.
As of today, however, only few works have been dedicated to this topic
based on relatively straightforward modeling methods,
{\color{magenta}
e.g., using the \SI{1.4}{\GHz} radio flux function or radio--X-ray
scaling relations, which are barely constrained by current observations
\citep[e.g.,][]{gleser2008,jelic2008}.
}
The data acquired in these observations are far from complete due to
the lack of systematic surveys targeting these diffuse sources,
especially in the low-frequency radio bands \citep[e.g.,][]{kale2016rev}.

This paper is prepared as follows.
In \autoref{sec:sky-simu} we introduce our new open-source software
\texttt{FG21sim} and use it to simulate the low-frequency radio sky,
among which a detailed simulation of radio halos in galaxy clusters has
been developed by applying the merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration
model.
In \autoref{sec:obs-simu} we employ the latest SKA1-Low layout
configuration to incorporate the practical instrumental effects into
the simulated sky maps.
We then quantitatively evaluate the contamination of radio halos to the
EoR signals and discuss the results in \autoref{sec:results}.
Finally we summarize our work in \autoref{sec:summary}.
Throughout this work we adopt a flat \lcdm{} cosmology with
$H_0 = \SI{100}{\hubble} = \SI{71}{\km\per\second\per\Mpc}$,
$\Omega_m = 0.27$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 1 - \Omega_m = 0.73$,
$\Omega_b = 0.046$, $n_s = 0.96$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.81$.
The quoted errors are at the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence level unless
otherwise stated.

\section{Simulation of Low-Frequency Radio Sky}
\label{sec:sky-simu}
%########################################################################

Based on our previous works \citep{wang2010,wang2013}, we have used the
Python programming language to develop the \texttt{FG21sim} software to
simulate the realistic low-frequency radio sky by taking into account the
contributions of our Galaxy, extragalactic point sources, and radio halos
in galaxy clusters.
Our software is open-sourced under the MIT License and is available at
\url{https://github.com/liweitianux/fg21sim},
where further documents and auxiliary data are provided.
Additional utilities are also developed to help the observational simulation,
which aims to integrate the instrumental responses of low-frequency radio
interferometers, as well as subsequent analyzing procedures.
%%%
\XU{The software is designed to take into account the
contributions of our Galaxy, extragalactic discrete sources (i.e.,
star-forming galaxies, radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
radio-loud AGNs), galaxy clusters, cosmic microwave background (CMB), and 21
cm signals of the EoR【既然是天空仿真，就不要有遗漏！！确认还缺什么！！】,
and it also has an interface to integrate instrumental responses of any
low-frequency radio interferometers.}

%%%

By consulting the latest SKA science book on the EoR survey strategies
\citep[e.g.,][]{koopmans2015rev}, we perform the simulations within
a \SI{8}{\MHz} band centered at \SI{158}{\MHz} for a
\SI[product-units=repeat]{10 x 10}{\degree}
sky region at (R.A., Dec.) = (\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{-27}{\degree}),
which locates at high galactic latitude ($b = \SI{-78.5}{\degree}$)
and passes through the zenith of SKA1-Low\footnote{%
  This sky region is also targeted by the MWA (EoR0 field;
  e.g., \citealt{beardsley2016}).}.
%%%
\XU{It has also been observed with MWA (EoR0 field), which enables us to us actual data to constrain our simulations.}
\LI{此工作没有如此使用 MWA 的观测来约束模拟图像}
%%%
The \SI{8}{\MHz} bandwidth is chosen to limit the cosmological evolution
effect for the 21~cm signals when calculating power spectra
\citep[e.g.][]{wyithe2004,thyagarajan2013},
and the relatively large region of \SI[product-units=repeat]{10 x 10}{\degree}
will cover the first side-lobe, which helps the image CLEAN procedure
in \autoref{sec:obs-simu}.
The simulated sky is pixelized into \num{1800 x 1800} with a pixel size
of \SI{20}{\arcsecond}.


%========================================================================
\subsection{Radio Halos in Galaxy Clusters}
\label{sec:cluster-halo}
%========================================================================

As a significant improvement over our past works, we consider in detail
the evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters by employing the
{\color{magenta}
merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration model, among which the
relativistic electrons are re-accelerated in the ICM via the second-order
Fermi process by the turbulence generated in merger events,
and also lose energies due to mechanisms including synchrotron radiation,
inverse Compton scattering off the CMB photons, and Coulomb collisions
with the thermal ICM.
For each galaxy cluster, we first simulate its merging history, which is
quantitatively described by a merger tree, by using the extended
Press-Schechter theory.
}
Then we calculate the turbulent acceleration efficiency and duration
for each merger event.
By combining the effects of turbulent acceleration and energy loss,
we obtain the temporal evolution of the relativistic electron spectrum,
and therefore the synchrotron emission and image of the radio halo.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Mass Function}
\label{sec:mass-function}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Press-Schechter formalism was originally advanced as one of the standard
method to predict the mass function of galaxy clusters and its evolution
in the Universe \citep{press1974}, and has been extended to combine with
the cold dark matter (CDM) models \citep[e.g.,][]{bond1991,lacey1993}.
In this formalism, the number density (i.e., the number per unit comoving
volume per unit mass) of dark matter halos (i.e., galaxy clusters) at a
certain redshift $z$ is
%%%
\XU{假定暗晕与星系团合体，其质量分布函数是有一个平移的！！}
\LI{PS 理论描述的是暗晕的质量及红移分布，而非星系团总质量；
因此需要再将 PS 理论给出的暗晕质量换算成星系团总质量：
$M^{\R{cl}} = M^{\R{DM}} / (1-f_{\R{gas}})$}
%%%
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ps-mass-func}
  n(M, z) \,\D{M} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{\langle{\rho}\rangle}{M}
  \frac{\delta_c(z)}{\sigma^2(M)} \left| \diff{\sigma(M)}{M} \right|
  \exp\!\left[ -\frac{\delta_c^2(z)}{2\sigma^2(M)} \right] \D{M},
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the dark matter halo mass,
$\langle {\rho} \rangle$ is the current mean density of the Universe,
$\delta_c(z)$ is the critical linear overdensity for a region to collapse
at redshift $z$ [see \autoref{eq:delta-crit}],
and $\sigma(M)$ is the current r.m.s.\ (root-mean-square) density
fluctuations within a sphere of mean mass $M$.

Considering the CDM model and the halo mass range covered by galaxy
clusters, it is reasonable to adopt the following power-law distribution
for the density perturbations \citep{sarazin2002,randall2002}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sigma-mass}
  \sigma(M) = \sigma_8 \left( \frac{M}{M_8} \right)^{-\alpha},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_8$ is the present-day r.m.s.\ density fluctuations on
a scale of \SI{8}{\per\hubble\Mpc},
$M_8 = (4\pi/3)(8 \,\si{\per\hubble\Mpc})^3 \langle{\rho}\rangle$
is the mass contained in a sphere of a radius \SI{8}{\per\hubble\Mpc},
and the exponent $\alpha = (n+3)/6$ with $n = -7/5$ \citep{randall2002}
is related to the fluctuations pattern whose power spectrum varies
with wavenumber $k$ as $k^n$.

Given a minimum dark matter halo mass of
$M_{\R{min}} = \SI{e14}{\solarmass}$ \TODO{ref???}
and a maximum redshift cut at $z_{\R{max}} = 4$,
{\color{magenta}
we are able to use \autoref{eq:ps-mass-func} to derive the total number
of dark matter halos in any given sky patch and their mass and redshift
distributions.
Then we run Monte Carlo simulations to generate the dark matter halo
sample with random masses $M_{\R{sim}}$ and redshifts $z_{\R{sim}}$.
By assuming that galaxy clusters have a gas fraction of
$f_{\R{gas}} \simeq \Omega_b/\Omega_m$, their total mass is therefore
given by $M_{\R{sim}}^{\R{cl}} = M_{\R{sim}} / (1 - f_{\R{gas}})$.
}
\XU{cl 建议改为 total}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Merging History}
\label{sec:merging-history}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dark matter halos (i.e., galaxy clusters) are formed hierarchically through
accretion and mergers.
The extended Press-Schechter theory outlined in \citet{lacey1993} provide
a way to describe their growth history in terms of the merger tree.
In order to build the merger tree for a dark matter halo, we start with
its current mass $M_{\R{sim}}$ and redshift $z_{\R{sim}}$ as randomly sampled
in \autoref{sec:mass-function}, and trace its growth history back in time
by running Monte Carlo simulations to randomly determine the mass change
$\Delta M$ at each step, which may be regarded either as a merger event
(if $\Delta M > \Delta M_c$) or as an accretion event
(if $\Delta M \leq \Delta M_c$).
{\color{magenta}
Considering that radio halos are usually associated with major mergers,
we choose $\Delta M_c = \SI{e13}{\solarmass}$ \TODO{ref???}
\LI{测试显示该参数对模拟结果影响很小}.}

We assume that during each growth step the dark matter halo mass increases
from $M_1$ at time $t_1$ to $M_2$ at a later time $t_2$ ($> t_1$).
Given $M_2$ and $t_2$, the conditional probability of the halo had
a progenitor being in the mass range $M_1 \to M_1 + \D{M_1}$ at an
earlier time $t_1$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eps-condprob}
  \R{Pr}(M_1, t_1 | M_2, t_2) \,\D{M_1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \frac{M_2}{M_1}
  \frac{\delta_{c1} - \delta_{c2}}{(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2)^{3/2}}
  \left| \diff{\sigma_1^2}{M_1} \right|
  \exp \!\left[ -\frac{(\delta_{c1} - \delta_{c2})^2}
    {2(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2)} \right] \D{M_1},
\end{equation}
where
$\delta_{ci} \equiv \delta_c(t_i)$, $\sigma_i \equiv \sigma(M_i)$, and $i =
1, 2$ is used to denote parameters defined at time $t_1$ and $t_2$,
respectively \citep{lacey1993,randall2002}.
By further introducing $S \equiv \sigma^2(M)$ and
$\omega \equiv \delta_c(t)$, this equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eps-condprob-simp}
  \R{Pr}(\Delta S, \Delta \omega) \,\D{\Delta S} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \frac{\Delta\omega}{(\Delta S)^{3/2}}
  \exp \!\left[ -\frac{(\Delta\omega)^2}{2 \Delta S} \right] \D{\Delta S}.
\end{equation}

{\color{magenta}
During the backward tracing of a dark matter halo, the time step size
$\Delta t$ (i.e., $\Delta\omega$) determines the mass resolution.
It is required that
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:dw-step}
  \Delta\omega \lesssim \left[
    S \left| \diff{\ln \sigma^2}{\ln M} \right|
    \left( \frac{\Delta M_c}{M} \right) \right]^{1/2},
\end{equation}
in order to resolve single mergers of mass $\Delta M_c \ll M$
\citep{lacey1993}.
Similar to \citet{randall2002}, we use an adaptive step size
$(\Delta\omega)_{\R{step}}$ that equals to half of this maximum value.
Given $\Delta\omega$ at a step, the mass change $\Delta S$ can be
randomly drawn from the following cumulative probability distribution
of sub-halo masses
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:cdf-sub-masses}
  \R{Pr}(<\!\Delta S, \Delta\omega) =
  \int_0^{\Delta S} \R{Pr}(\Delta S', \Delta\omega) \,\D{\Delta S'} =
  \erfc \!\left( \frac{\Delta \omega}{\sqrt{2 \Delta S}} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\erfc(x) = 1 - \erf(x)$ is the complementary error function
\LI{这是统计里的常用特殊函数，不需引文},
and the halo's progenitor mass $M_1$ is then obtained as
$S_1 = S_2 + \Delta S$
\LI{$S = \sigma^2(M)$ 与 $M$ 反相关，因此公式右边的加号是正确的}.

and have typical lifetimes $\tau_{\R{halo}} \lesssim \SI{1}{\Gyr}$
\citep[e.g.,][]{brunetti2009,cassano2016},
we trace the merging history of each dark matter halo by a maximum
backward time of \SI{3}{\Gyr} from its \enquote{current} age
$t_{\R{sim}}$ (i.e., $z_{\R{sim}}$).
Once the merger tree been built, we again transform the mass of
dark matter halos to the total mass of galaxy clusters according to
$M^{\R{cl}} = M / (1 - f_{\R{gas}})$, and we extract all the merger

\subsubsection{Radio Halo Emergence and Evolution}
\label{sec:halos}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the adopted merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration model, there
exists a population of primary (or fossil) high-energy electrons permeating
the ICM, which are thought to be injected by active galactic nucleus (AGN)
activities (quasars, radio galaxies, etc.), and by star formation in
normal galaxies (supernovae, galactic winds, etc.) during the cluster
life \citep[see][for a review]{blasi2007rev},
then the turbulence generated by intense mergers interact with the ICM
and accelerate the primary electrons to be highly relativistic, resulting
in the observed diffuse synchrotron radiation.

Besides the turbulent acceleration, electrons in the ICM lose energies
via synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering off the CMB photons,
Coulomb collisions, etc.\ \citep{sarazin1999}.
Given a population of electrons with isotropic energy distribution, and
considering both the energy gain and loss mechanisms, the temporal evolution
of the electron spectrum is governed by the following Fokker-Planck
diffusion-advection equation \citep{eilek1991,schlickeiser2002}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fokkerplanck}
  \pdiff{n(\gamma,t)}{t} = \pdiff{}{\gamma} \left[ n(\gamma,t) \left(
      \left| \diff{\gamma}{t} \right| -
      \frac{2}{\gamma} D_{\gamma\gamma}(\gamma, t) \right) \right] +
    \pdiff{}{\gamma} \left[ D_{\gamma\gamma} \pdiff{n(\gamma,t)}{\gamma}
    \right] + Q_e(\gamma,t),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma \approx p / (m_e c)$ is the Lorentz factor of electrons,
$n(\gamma, t)$ is the isotropic number density of the electron population,
$D_{\gamma\gamma}(\gamma, t)$ is the diffusion coefficient describing
the interactions between the turbulence and electrons,
$|\R{d}\gamma / \R{d}t|$ is the energy loss rate,
and $Q_e(\gamma, t)$ describes the electron injection.

%........................................................................
\setcounter{sssseccount}{0}
\ssssec{Electron Injection}

It is reasonable to assume that the primary electrons were constantly
injected into the ICM during the cluster life and had a power-law
spectrum of index $s = 2.3$ \citep[e.g.,][]{sarazin1999}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:electron-inj}
  Q_e(\gamma, t) \equiv Q_e(\gamma) = K_e \,\gamma^{-s}.
\end{equation}
By further assuming that the total energy of injected electrons is a
fraction, $\eta_e$, of the total thermal energy \citep{cassano2005}
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_e \,\tau_{\R{cl}} \int_{\gamma_{\R{min}}}^{\gamma_{\R{max}}}
  Q_e(\gamma') \gamma' \,\D{\gamma'}
  = \eta_e \,\epsilon_{\R{th}},
\end{equation}
and given $\gamma_{\R{min}} \ll \gamma_{\R{\max}}$,
the injection rate $K_e$ can be derived to be
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:injrate}
  K_e \simeq \frac{(s-2)\,\eta_e\,\epsilon_{\R{th}}}{\epsilon_e\,\tau_{\R{cl}}}
    \gamma_{\R{min}}^{s-2},
\end{equation}
{\color{magenta}
where $\tau_{\R{cl}} \simeq t_{\R{sim}}$ is the cluster's age at its
\enquote{current} redshift $z_{\R{sim}}$ as simulated in
}
\autoref{sec:mass-function},
and $\epsilon_e = m_e c^2$ is the electron's still energy.
In addition, the thermal energy density of the ICM, $\epsilon_{\R{th}}$,
is calculated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy-density-thermal}
  \epsilon_{\R{th}} = \frac{3}{2} \,n_{\R{th}} \,k_BT_{\R{cl}},
\end{equation}
and the thermal number density, $n_{\R{th}}$, is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:number-density-thermal}
  n_{\R{th}} \simeq \frac{3 f_{\R{gas}} M}{4\pi \mu m_u \,r^3_{\R{vir}}},
\end{equation}
where
{\color{magenta}
$M$ is the cluster's total mass (i.e., virial mass),
$r_{\R{vir}}$ is the virial radius [see \autoref{eq:radius-virial}],
$\mu \simeq 0.6$ is the mean molecular weight \citep[e.g.,][]{ettori2013},
and $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit.
The cluster's mean temperature is approximated with the virial temperature:
$k_BT_{\R{cl}} \simeq k_BT_{\R{vir}} = G M \mu m_u / (2 \,r_{\R{vir}})$.
}

As for the initial spectrum of electrons $n_e(\gamma, t_0)$ for solving
\autoref{eq:fokkerplanck}, it is derived by evolving the accumulated spectrum
$n_e'(\gamma) = t_0 K_e \gamma^{-s}$ for \SI{\sim 1}{\Gyr} with only energy
losses, where $t_0$ is the cosmic age when the first merger event begins
\citep[e.g.,][]{brunetti2007}.

%........................................................................
\ssssec{Turbulent Acceleration}

The interaction details between the turbulence and the cluster ICM
are complicated and still poorly understood.
Among the several different particle acceleration mechanisms could be
potentially triggered by the turbulence, the most important one is that
the turbulence dissipates its energy and accelerates particles by interacting
with the relativistic particles (e.g., cosmic rays) in the ICM via the
transit time damping process
\citep[and references therein]{brunetti2007,brunetti2011},
and the associated diffusion coefficient is given as
\citep{pinzke2017,miniati2015}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dpp}
  D_{\gamma\gamma} = \gamma^2 \frac{4\pi \zeta}{X_{\R{CR}} L_{\R{turb}}}
    \frac{\langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle^2}{c_s^3},
\end{equation}
where
$\zeta \sim \numrange{0.1}{0.3}$ is an efficiency factor characterizing
the plasma instabilities (e.g., due to spatial or temporal intermittency),
$X_{\R{CR}} = \epsilon_{\R{CR}} / \epsilon_{\R{th}} \sim \SI{1}{\percent}$
is the relative energy density of cosmic rays with respect to the thermal ICM,
{\color{magenta}
$L_{\R{turb}} \simeq r_{\R{vir}}/3$ is the turbulence injection scale
\citep{miniati2015},
}
$\langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle$ is the turbulence velocity dispersion,
and $c_s$ is the sound speed in the ICM.

The total kinetic energy carried by a merger can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy-merger}
  E_{\R{merger}} = \frac{1}{2} f_{\R{gas}} M_{\R{sub}} v^2_{\R{sub}}
    \simeq \frac{1}{2} f_{\R{gas}} M_{\R{sub}}
    \frac{G M_{\R{main}}}{r^2_{\R{main}}},
\end{equation}
{\color{magenta}
where $M_{\R{main}}$ and $M_{\R{sub}}$ are the masses of the two merging
clusters, and $r_{\R{main}}$ is the virial radius of the main cluster.
}
To further estimate the velocity dispersion of the turbulence, we assume
that a fraction, $\eta_{\R{turb}}$, of the merger kinetic energy was
transferred into turbulent waves, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy-turb}
  E_{\R{turb}} = \frac{1}{2} M_{\R{turb}}^{\R{gas}}
    \langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle = \eta_{\R{turb}} E_{\R{merger}},
\end{equation}
where
$M_{\R{turb}}^{\R{gas}}$ is the gas mass enclosed in the turbulent region,
i.e., within radius of $L_{\R{turb}}$.
By adopting a NFW density profile \citep{navarro1997}, the distribution
of mass
{\color{magenta}
in fraction of the total mass is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mass-dist-nfw}
  f_{\R{nfw}}(s) = \frac{M(< s \,r_{\R{vir}})}{M} =
    \frac{\ln(1 + c s) - c s / (1 + c s)}{\ln(1 + c) - c / (1 + c)},
\end{equation}
}
where $s = r / r_{\R{vir}}$ is the normalized radius in units of the
virial radius, and $c \sim 5$ is the concentration parameter for
clusters \citep{lokas2001}.
Therefore we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mass-turb}
  M_{\R{turb}} = f_{\R{gas}} M_{\R{merged}}(<L_{\R{turb}})
    = f_{\R{gas}} f_{\R{nfw}}(1/3) (M_{\R{main}} + M_{\R{sub}}),
\end{equation}
and by substituting this into \autoref{eq:energy-turb} we obtain
the turbulence velocity dispersion as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:turb-velocity-dispersion}
  \langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle =
    \frac{\eta_{\R{turb}}}{f_{\R{nfw}}(1/3)}
    \frac{M_{\R{sub}}}{M_{\R{main}} + M_{\R{sub}}}
    \frac{G M_{\R{main}}}{r^2_{\R{main}}}.
\end{equation}

Generally, the turbulence generated during major mergers is subsonic
with a Mach number of
$\mathcal{M}_{\R{turb}} = \sqrt{\langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle} / c_s
  \sim \numrange{0.2}{0.5}$,
and its acceleration efficiency to electrons can be described by the
acceleration timescale (i.e., the reciprocal of the acceleration rate)
$\tau_{\R{acc}} = 4 D_{\gamma\gamma} / \gamma^2 \sim \SI{0.1}{\Gyr}$,
which is independent of the electron momentum.

%........................................................................
\ssssec{Acceleration Periods}

The whole merger process may last for \SIrange{2}{3}{\Gyr}
\citep[e.g.,][]{tormen2004,cassano2016},
but only when the strong turbulence exists can the turbulent acceleration
become effective, which persists for a relatively short period of time:
$\tau_{\R{turb}} \simeq 2 L_{\R{turb}} / v_{\R{imp}}$,
where $v_{\R{imp}}$ is the relative impact velocity between the merging
clusters \citep{miniati2015}.
Starting from a sufficiently large distance with zero velocity,
the relative impact velocity of two merging clusters with mass
$M_{\R{main}}$ and $M_{\R{sub}}$ is given by \citep{sarazin2002,cassano2005}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:v-imp}
  v_{\R{imp}} \simeq \left[
    \frac{2G (M_{\R{main}} + M_{\R{sub}})}{r_{\R{main}}}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\eta_v} \right)\right]^{1/2},
\end{equation}
with $\eta_v \simeq 4 \,(1 + M_{\R{sub}}/M_{\R{main}})^{1/3}$.
Therefore, we estimate that major mergers generally have an effective
turbulent acceleration duration $\tau_{\R{turb}} \sim \SI{0.5}{\Gyr}$.

For each merger event
$(M^{(i)}_{\R{main}}, M^{(i)}_{\R{sub}}, t^{(i)}_{\R{merger}})$
of a galaxy cluster as simulated in \autoref{sec:merging-history},
we calculate the corresponding turbulent acceleration duration
$\tau^{(i)}_{\R{turb}}$, and solve the above Fokker-Planck equation with
{\color{magenta}
both turbulent acceleration and energy losses among periods
$[t^{(i)}_{\R{merger}}, t^{(i)}_{\R{merger}}+\tau^{(i)}_{\R{turb}}]$,
while there are only energy losses at other times.
}

%........................................................................
\ssssec{Energy Losses}

There are several different mechanisms through which the relativistic
electrons in the ICM may lose energies \citep{sarazin1999},
and we consider the following three major mechanisms in our simulation.
The first one is the inverse Compton scattering off the CMB photons
whose energy loss rate is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eloss-ic}
  \left( \diff{\gamma}{t} \right)_{\R{IC}} =
    \num{-4.32e-4} \,\gamma^2 (1+z)^4
    \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}].
\end{equation}

{\color{magenta}
Secondly, with the \si{\uG}-level magnetic field permeating the ICM,
relativistic electrons will produce synchrotron radiation and lose
energy at a rate of
}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eloss-syn}
  \left( \diff{\gamma}{t} \right)_{\R{syn}} =
    \num{-4.10e-5} \,\gamma^2 \left( \frac{B}{\SI{1}{\uG}} \right)^2
    \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}],
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the magnetic field strength.
{\color{magenta}
We assume that the magnetic field is uniform and its energy density
is a fraction of the thermal energy density, i.e.,
$u_B = B^2 / (8\pi) = \eta_B \,\epsilon_{\R{th}}$,
where $\eta_B$ is the energy density ratio between the magnetic field
and the thermal ICM \citep[e.g.,][]{bohringer2016}.
}

The last mechanism considered here is that electrons lose energy
by interacting with the thermal ICM via Coulomb collisions, which gives
the loss rate
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eloss-coul}
  \left( \diff{\gamma}{t} \right)_{\R{Coul}} =
  \num{-3.79e4} \,n_{\R{th}} \left[ 1 +
    \frac{\ln(\gamma/n_{\R{th}})}{75} \right] \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}],
\end{equation}
where $n_{\R{th}}$ is the thermal number density
[\autoref{eq:number-density-thermal}] in units of [\si{\per\cm\cubed}].

The inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation dominate
energy losses at the high-energy regime ($\gamma \gtrsim 1000$),
and Coulomb collisions are the main energy-loss mechanism for lower
energy electrons ($\gamma \lesssim 100$).
{\color{magenta}
Therefore, electrons with intermediate energies (e.g., $\gamma \sim 300$)
have a very long lifetime and can accumulate in the ICM as the
cluster grows \citep{sarazin1999}, which may become the primary
electrons to be accelerated \emph{in situ} by the turbulence.
}

%........................................................................
\ssssec{Numerical Method}

Now with all the coefficients in \autoref{eq:fokkerplanck} been determined,
we can evolve the initial electron spectrum $n_e(\gamma,\, t=t_0)$ via
solving this Fokker-Planck equation, and derive the \enquote{current}
electron spectrum $n_e(\gamma,\, t=t_{\R{sim}})$,
{\color{magenta}
where $t_{\R{sim}}$ corresponds to the simulated redshift $z_{\R{sim}}$
as obtained in \autoref{sec:mass-function}.
}
An efficient numerical method proposed by \citet{chang1970} is utilized
to solve the equation, under the no-flux boundary condition \citep{park1996}.
However, to avoid unphysical pile-up of electrons around the lower boundary
{\color{magenta} due to the applied boundary condition},
we define a \enquote{buffer} region below $\gamma_{\R{buf}}$, within which
the spectral data are replaced by extrapolating from the data above
$\gamma_{\R{buf}}$ as a power-law spectrum \citep{donnert2014}.
We adopt a logarithmic grid for $\gamma \in [1, 10^5]$ with 200 cells,
and let the lower buffer region span 10 cells.

%........................................................................
\ssssec{Image Generation}

After deriving the \enquote{current} electron spectrum
$n_e(\gamma, t_{\R{sim}})$, the synchrotron emissivity at frequency
$\nu$ is given by \citep{rybicki1979}
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:jnu-sync}
  % unit: [erg/s/Hz/cm^3]
  J_{\R{syn}}(\nu) = \frac{\sqrt{3} \, e^3 B}{m_e c^2}
    \!\int_{\gamma_{\R{min}}}^{\gamma_{\R{max}}} \!\!\!\int_0^{\pi/2}\!
    n_e(\gamma, t_{\R{sim}}) F(\nu/\nu_c)
    \sin^2 \!\theta \,\D{\theta} \,\D{\gamma},
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the pitch angle of electrons,
and $F(\nu/\nu_c) = (\nu/\nu_c) \int_{\nu/\nu_c}^{\infty} K_{5/3}(x) \,\D{x}$
is the synchrotron kernel,
with $K_{5/3}(x)$ the modified Bessel function of 5/3 order,
$\nu_c = (3/2) \,\gamma^2 \nu_L \sin\theta
= 3 e B \gamma^2 \sin\theta / (4\pi m_e c)$
the electron's critical frequency.
The {\color{magenta} simulated} radio halo is assumed to be the same size as
the turbulent region \citep[e.g.,][]{vazza2011}:
$r_{\R{halo}} \simeq L_{\R{turb}} \simeq r_{\R{vir}}/3$,
therefore its radio power at a certain frequency (i.e., spectral power) is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-power}
  % unit: [W/Hz]
  P(\nu) = \frac{4\pi}{3} r_{\R{halo}}^3 J_{\R{syn}}(\nu),
\end{equation}
{\color{magenta}
and its flux density measured at the same frequency is
\citep[e.g.,][]{hogg1999}
}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-flux}
  % unit: [Jy] = 1e-26 [W/Hz/m^2]
  S(\nu) = \frac{(1+z_{\R{sim}}) P(\nu(1+z_{\R{sim}}))}{4\pi D_{\!L}^2(z_{\R{sim}})},
\end{equation}
where $D_{\!L}(z_{\R{sim}})$ is the luminosity distance to the halo at
redshift $z_{\R{sim}}$,
{\color{magenta}
and the $(1 + z_{\R{sim}})$ factor accounts for the $K$ correction.
}

To generate the image for the simulated radio halos, we adopt an exponential
profile for the azimuthally averaged brightness distribution \citep{murgia2009}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-profile}
  I_{\nu}(\theta) = I_{\nu,0} \exp(-3 \,\theta / \theta_{\R{halo}}),
\end{equation}
where $\theta = r / D_{\!A}(z_{\R{sim}})$ is the angular radius from the halo
center with $D_{\!A}(z_{\R{sim}})$ the angular diameter distance to the halo,
and $I_{\nu,0} = 9 S(\nu) / (2\pi \theta^2_{\R{halo}})$ is the central
brightness.
In addition, a random ellipticity $f_e$ and a random rotation angle
$\phi$ are applied to each of the halo images.

%........................................................................
\ssssec{Parameters Tuning}

Our model has the following 5 parameters:
(1) fraction of the merger energy transferred into the turbulence:
$\eta_{\R{turb}} \sim \SI{10}{\percent}$;
(2) relative energy density in the magnetic field:
$\eta_B \sim \SI{0.1}{\percent}$;
(3) ratio of the total energy of injected electrons to the total thermal
energy: $\eta_e \sim \SI{0.1}{\percent}$;
(4) efficiency of the ICM plasma instabilities:
$\zeta \sim \numrange{0.1}{0.3}$;
(5) relative energy density in the cosmic rays:
$X_{\R{CR}} \sim \SI{1}{\percent}$.
{\color{magenta}
Although all of them have reasonable constraints from either observational
evidences or simulation studies, it is essential to further tune them in
order to achieve better agreements with the observations.
To this end, we have collected all current observed radio halos
(\autoref{tab:halos-observed}; as of 2018 January), and compare the
\SI{1.4}{\GHz} integrated flux function between our simulated radio halos
and the observations.  We have explored various parameter configurations,
and for each configuration we have repeated the simulation for 500 times
in order to take into account the Monte Carlo uncertainties as introduced in
Sections~\ref{sec:mass-function} and \ref{sec:merging-history}.
Considering that the current observations are far from complete,
especially in the low-flux regime, our strategy was requiring that the
integrated flux function of simulations agreed with the observed one
in the high-flux regime within simulation uncertainties.
In consequence, we have chosen a set of model parameters with
$\eta_{\R{turb}} = \SI{10}{\percent}$, $\eta_B = \SI{0.1}{\percent}$,
$\eta_e = \SI{0.1}{\percent}$, $\zeta = 0.1$,
and $X_{\R{CR}} = \SI{1.5}{\percent}$,
and we show in \autoref{fig:halos-simucomp-example}(a) the \SI{1.4}{\GHz}
integrated flux function comparison result.

With the purpose of better characterizing the impacts of radio halos
on the EoR detection, we adopt the above tuned parameter configuration
and repeat the radio halos simulation 100 times, given the fact that
radio halos can vary significantly across sky regions.
The mean (r.m.s.) brightness temperature of the 100 simulations is
$24.9_{-20.0}^{+74.3}$ \si{\mK} ($2\,753_{-1\,972}^{+10\,409}$ \si{\mK}),
and \autoref{fig:halos-simucomp-example}(b) shows a typical example
of the simulated radio halos at \SI{158}{\MHz} with mean (r.m.s.)
brightness temperature of \SI{25.2}{\mK} (\SI{3947}{\mK}).
We will also use this typical example to illustrate part of our results
and discussions in \autoref{sec:results}.

\subsection{Other Foreground Components}
\label{sec:fg-other}
%========================================================================

{\color{magenta}
In order to better evaluate the radio halos of our focus, we not only
compare them to the target EoR signal whose simulation will be described
in \autoref{sec:eor-signal}, but also do comparisons to several other
foreground components, which include the Galactic synchrotron and
free-free emissions, and the extragalactic point sources,
based on our previous work \citep[and references therein]{wang2010}.
}

The Galactic synchrotron map was simulated by extrapolating the
Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} all-sky map as the template to lower frequencies
with a power-law spectrum.
We have made use of the $N_{\R{side}} = 2048$
(pixel size \SI{\sim 1.72}{\arcminute})
high resolution version of the Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} map\footnote{%
  The reprocessed Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} map:
  \url{http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/cosmos/haslam_map/}.
}
reprocessed by \citet{remazeilles2015}, which had significantly better
instrument calibration and more accurate subtraction of extragalactic
sources.
And we also used the all-sky synchrotron spectral index map made by
\citet{giardino2002} to account for the index variation with sky positions.
The Galactic free-free emission was derived from the \Halpha{} survey data
\citep{finkbeiner2003}, which we corrected for dust absorption first
\citep{dickinson2003}, by employing the tight relation between the \Halpha{}
and free-free emissions due to their common origins.
And the extragalactic foreground of point sources is contributed by the
following different types of sources: star-forming and starburst galaxies,
radio-quiet AGNs, Fanaroff-Riley type I and type II AGNs, GHz-peaked
spectrum AGNs, and compact steep spectrum AGNs.

The simulated example maps at \SI{158}{\MHz} are shown in
\autoref{fig:gsyn-gff-ps-21cm}(a--c),
and the mean (r.m.s.) brightness temperatures of the Galactic synchrotron
emission, Galactic free-free emission, and extragalactic point sources
are \SI{251.4}{\kelvin} (\SI{251.7}{\kelvin}),
\SI{0.19}{\kelvin} (\SI{0.20}{\kelvin}),
and \SI{45.5}{\kelvin} (\SI{59224}{\kelvin}), respectively.

\subsection{EoR Signal}
\label{sec:eor-signal}
%========================================================================

The sky maps of the EoR 21~cm signals were created using the 2016
data release from the Evolution Of 21~cm Structure project\footnote{%
  Evolution Of 21~cm Structure project:
  \url{http://homepage.sns.it/mesinger/EOS.html}},
which were generated with \texttt{21cmFAST} version 2 \citep{mesinger2011}
within a cube of 1.6 comoving \si{\Gpc} and 1024 cells along each side,
and covered a redshift range of \numrange{5.0}{86.5} \citep{mesinger2016}.
We extracted the image slices at needed frequencies (i.e., redshifts) from
the \enquote{light-cone cubes} of the recommended \enquote{faint galaxies}
case, and then tiled and re-scaled them to have the same sky coverage and
pixel size as our foreground maps.

The extracted image at \SI{158}{\MHz} is shown in
\autoref{fig:gsyn-gff-ps-21cm}(d),
and the mean (r.m.s.) brightness temperature is
\SI{9.53}{\mK} (\SI{10.69}{\mK}).

\section{Observational Simulation}
\label{sec:obs-simu}
%########################################################################

It is essential to incorporate the practical instrumental effects of
radio interferometers in order to properly evaluate the possible
contamination induced by radio halos on the EoR detection.
We therefore adopted the latest SKA1-Low layout configuration\footnote{%
  SKA1-Low Configuration Coordinates:
  \url{https://astronomers.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SKA-TEL-SKO-0000422_02_SKA1_LowConfigurationCoordinates-1.pdf}
  (released on 2016 May 21)
}
to simulate the \enquote{observed} images for the above simulated sky
maps of foreground components and EoR signal.
According to the current configuration,
the SKA1-Low interferometer consists of 512 stations, with 224 of them
randomly distributed within the \enquote{core} of \SI{1000}{\meter} in
diameter, while rest of the stations are grouped into \enquote{clusters}
and placed on 3 spiral arms extending up to a radius of
\SI{\sim 35}{\kilo\meter}.
Each station has 256 antennas randomly distributed with a minimum separation
of $d_{\R{min}} = \SI{1.5}{\meter}$ inside a circular region of
\SI{35}{\meter} in diameter \citep[e.g.,][]{mort2017}.
With this layout configuration, the dense core makes the SKA1-Low very
sensitive to the EoR signal, while the long baselines greatly help the
foreground characterization and removal, as well as other scientific goals.

We divide the chosen \SIrange{154}{162}{\MHz} frequency band into 51
channels with a frequency resolution of \SI{160}{\kilo\hertz}.
For each component, we simulate the input sky maps at every frequency
channel as described in \autoref{sec:sky-simu},
and then use the \texttt{OSKAR}\footnote{%
  OSKAR: \url{https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR} (version 2.7.0)}
simulator \citep{mort2010} to perform observational simulations
for \SI{6}{\hour} ($\pm \SI{3}{\hour}$ in Hour Angle) with the
SKA1-Low layout configuration.
The simulated visibility data are imaged through the
\texttt{WSClean}\footnote{%
  WSClean: \url{https://sourceforge.net/p/wsclean} (version 2.5)}
imager \citep{offringa2014} using Briggs' weighting with
robustness of 0 \citep{briggs1995},
and the created images are cropped to keep only the central
\SI[product-units=repeat]{4 x 4}{\degree} regions for subsequent analyses.
{\color{magenta}
Hence we properly integrate the instrumental effects into the simulated
sky maps and obtain the \enquote{observed} image cube consisting of a
series of images among the selected frequency band.
Considering that the CLEAN algorithm does not work well with the diffuse
sources, we directly use the dirty images for the EoR signal and the
diffuse Galactic emission, which are in sufficiently good quality,
thanks to the dense core layout and good $uv$ coverage of SKA1-Low.
While for the radio halos and extragalactic point sources, we create
image cubes using the CLEAN algorithm with joined-channel deconvolution
to ensure the spectral smoothness \citep{offringa2017}, which is crucial
to extract the EoR signal from the overwhelming foregrounds.

As mentioned in \autoref{sec:fg-other}, we also simulate several other
foreground components for providing intuitive comparisons to radio halos.
The two diffuse Galactic emissions are combined to simplify the
observational simulation and subsequent analyses, as the free-free
emission is much weaker than the synchrotron radiation.
Similar to the real-time peeling of brightest sources in practical data
analysis pipeline of radio interferometers
\citep[e.g.,][]{mitchell2008,intema2009}, we assume that the brightest
ones with \SI{158}{\MHz} flux density $S > \SI{50}{\mJy}$ \TODO{check}
are peeled to simplify the imaging process \citep[e.g.,][]{pindor2011}.
Finally, we have the \enquote{observed} image cubes of the EoR signal,
radio halos, the Galactic diffuse emission (with both synchrotron and
free-free emission), and the extragalactic point sources (with the
brightest ones removed).}

\section{Results and Discussions}
\label{sec:results}
%########################################################################

Using the simulated image cubes, we can now calculate both the
two-dimensional (2D) and one-dimensional (1D) power spectra for each
component, from which we can quantitatively evaluate the contamination
to the EoR measurements contributed by radio halos, and discuss the large
fluctuations of radio halos across sky regions.
Besides the focused frequency band around \SI{158}{\MHz}, we investigate
the impacts of radio halos at lower and higher bands centered at
\SI{124}{\MHz} and \SI{196}{\MHz}, respectively.
We also discuss how the power spectra may be affected by the instrumental
frequency structures resulting from the calibration errors as well other
instrumental and observational effects.

%========================================================================
\subsection{2D Power Spectra and EoR Window}
\label{sec:ps2d}
%========================================================================

Given the elusive EoR signal, current-generation radio interferometers
do not have sufficient sensitivity to directly image its structures,
thus statistically probing the signal by measuring its power spectra is
the more feasible and promising way.
The redshifted 21~cm EoR signal as observed at different frequencies
represents a fully three-dimensional (3D) data cube, where the two angular
dimensions describe the transverse distances on the sky and the spectral
dimension characterizes the line-of-sight distance to the \Hi{} sources.
Since the \Hi{} field is homogeneous and isotropic, its 3D power spectrum
will have spherical symmetry.  Although in practice this symmetry will be
distorted along the line of sight due to peculiar velocities of matter
particles, the redshift-space distortion is reasonably predictable
\citep{majumdar2016}.
Therefore, the 3D power spectrum $P(\mathbf{k})$ of the EoR signal can
be averaged in spherical shells of radius $k$, yielding the 1D power
spectrum $P(k)$, which effectively compresses the information in the
\Hi{} field and greatly increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over
the per-pixel SNR in a direct imaging observation
\citep{morales2004,datta2010}.

However, the 1D spherical-averaged power spectrum of the 21~cm signal
will be severely contaminated by the overwhelming foreground emissions
presented in the observations, especially due to the bright extragalactic
point sources, whose small-scale angular structures will mix into the
line-of-sight fluctuations of 21~cm signal when spherically averaging
the 3D power spectrum.
Given an observed image cube, the foreground sources (e.g, Galactic
diffuse emissions, extragalactic point sources) are generally isotropic
among the two angular dimensions, which are very different from the
frequency dimension.
Hence it is more appropriate to average the 3D power spectrum
$P(\mathbf{k})$ over angular annuli of constant
$\kperp \equiv \sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$ for each line-of-sight plane
$\klos \equiv k_z$, yielding the 2D power spectrum $P(\kperp, \klos)$.
The 21~cm signal fluctuates rapidly along the frequency dimension (i.e.,
line-of-sight direction), thus much of its power distribute to the
high-\klos{} region in the $(\kperp, \klos)$ plane, while the
spectral-smooth foreground emissions are supposed to reside in
the low-\klos{} region.
Although some instrumental and observational effects (e.g., chromatic
primary beams and side-lobes, calibration errors) throw the strong
foreground contamination from the purely angular (\kperp) modes
into the line-of-sight (\klos) dimension, resulting in an expanded
wedge-like contamination region (i.e., the \enquote{foreground wedge}),
a region relatively free of foregrounds is preserved at the top-left
area of the 2D power spectrum, i.e., the \enquote{EoR window}
\citep[e.g.,][]{datta2010,morales2012,liu2014}.
The foreground avoidance method makes use of the 2D power spectrum and
measures the 21~cm signal only inside the well-defined EoR window.
It is anticipated that the powerful 2D power spectrum will be the
default technique for the EoR detection adopted by current and forthcoming
radio interferometers, e.g., MWA \citep{trott2016,beardsley2016},
PAPER \citep{pober2013}, and HERA \citep{deboer2017}.

\begin{figure*}

    (on the top left) and the contaminating wedge (the bottom right).
  }
\end{figure*}

When calculating the 2D power spectrum from the image cube obtained in
\autoref{sec:obs-simu}, the Blackman-Nuttall window function is applied
along the frequency dimension in order to suppress the side-lobes
associated with the Fourier transformation of the finite frequency
bandwidth \citep[e.g.,][]{trott2015,chapman2016}.
We present the 2D power spectra of the simulated EoR signal and foreground
components among the \SIrange{154}{162}{\MHz} frequency band in
\autoref{fig:ps2d}, where we also mark the boundary between the EoR window
and the contaminating foreground wedge.
We use the refined EoR window boundary proposed by \citet{thyagarajan2013}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eor-window}
  \klos \geq \frac{H_0 E(z) D_{\!M}(z)}{c (1+z)} \left[
    \kperp \sin\Theta +
    \frac{e}{B} \frac{2\pi f_{21}}{(1+z) D_{\!M}(z)} \right],
\end{equation}
where $E(z) = \sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}}$ is the redshift
evolution factor \citep{hogg1999},
$D_{\!M}(z)$ is the transverse comoving distance at redshift $z$,
$c$ is the speed of light,
$B = \SI{8}{\MHz}$ is the frequency bandwidth of the image cube for
calculating the 2D power spectrum, and $f_{21} = \SI{1420.4}{\MHz}$
is the rest-frame frequency of the 21~cm line.
The $\Theta$ is the angular distance of the foreground sources from
the field center, hence a soft limit to the \klos{} contamination is
imposed by the instrument field of view (FoV), i.e.,
$\Theta \simeq \R{FoV}/2$ \citep{morales2012}.
The parameter $e$ denotes the number of characteristic convolution widths
($\propto B^{-1}$) for the spillover region caused by the variations in
instrumental frequency response, which spill the contamination from the
wedge into the regions beyond \citep{thyagarajan2013}.
In this work, we choose $\Theta_{158} = \SI{6}{\degree}$ (corresponding to
about 3 times of the SKA1-Low's FoV at \SI{158}{\MHz}) and $e = 3$
for a very conservative EoR window boundary.

As shown in \autoref{fig:ps2d},
the EoR signal distributes its powers across all \klos{} modes, reflecting
its rapid fluctuations along the line-of-sight dimension, though the
smaller \klos{} modes occupy relatively more powers.
On the other hand, the spectral-smooth foregrounds have most of the powers
located at the low-\klos{} regions, along with the wedge-shaped
contaminating regions extending to the high-\kperp{} and high-\klos{}
areas, where the angular contamination is mixed into the line-of-sight
modes because of the intrinsic chromaticity of radio interferometers as
well as other instrumental and observational effects.
As expected, the Galactic diffuse emissions and point sources dominate the
low-\kperp{} and high-\kperp{} regions on the 2D power spectra, respectively,
while radio halos mainly appear among
$\SI{0.2}{\per\Mpc} \leq \kperp \leq \SI{1.0}{\per\Mpc}$,
corresponding to \SIrange[range-units=repeat]{2.4}{12}{\arcminute},
which are the typical angular sizes of radio halos.
Moreover, radio halos show some power beyond the boundary and hence can
contaminate the 21~cm signal inside the EoR window, though a conservative
EoR window boundary is already chosen.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ps2d-halos-ratio-band158}
  \caption{\label{fig:ps2d-ratio}%
    2D power spectrum ratios of radio halos with respect to

    and \textbf{(c)} the extragalactic point sources.
    All sub-figures share the same colorbar with logarithmic scale.
    The white dashed lines mark the same EoR window boundary as in
    \autoref{fig:ps2d}.
  }
\end{figure*}

In order to better illustrate the relative importance of radio halos,
we calculate the power spectrum ratios by dividing the 2D power spectrum
of radio halos by that of the other components \citep{trott2015},
as shown in \autoref{fig:ps2d-ratio}.
The wedge-shape contamination is evident in \autoref{fig:ps2d-ratio}(a),
and is relatively well restricted below the chosen EoR window boundary.
Nevertheless, some power of radio halos still leaks into the EoR window
as similarly shown in \autoref{fig:ps2d}(b),
and the leaked power may be tens of percent of the EoR signal at
$\SI{0.2}{\per\Mpc} \leq \kperp \leq \SI{1.0}{\per\Mpc}$ or even
as strong as the signal near the EoR window boundary,
which can hamper the reliable measurement of 21~cm signal inside the
EoR window.
Compared to the diffuse Galactic foreground, radio halos are a much
stronger contamination source at large-\kperp{} ($> \SI{0.2}{\per\Mpc}$)
modes.
While the extragalactic point sources obviously dominate all the
large-\kperp{} modes, radio halos may generate powers up to several
percents of the power of point sources at their characteristic scales
(intermediate \kperp{} modes) inside the EoR window and near the boundary,
hence can imprint a non-negligible contamination upon the EoR measurement.

%========================================================================
\subsection{1D Power Spectra and Sky Fluctuations}
\label{sec:ps1d}
%========================================================================

As mentioned in \autoref{sec:cluster-halo}, radio halos have large
fluctuations across sky regions, and it is essential to take this into
account.
Here we make use of all the 100 simulation runs of radio halos, and
calculate the 1D power spectra for them, which are derived from the 2D
power spectra by averaging over constant $k = \sqrt{\kperp^2 + \klos^2}$.
As shown in \autoref{fig:ps1d}(a), radio halos are stronger than the
EoR signal by about 1 to 5 orders of magnitude throughout all scales
within the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence interval (c.i.), with the median
power being about 1000 times stronger than the EoR signal.
Compared to the other foreground components, radio halos are about 10
times larger than the diffuse Galactic emission at small scales (i.e.,
large \kperp{}), and the power ratio of radio halos to point sources
is about one percent at large \kperp{} modes, but increases to a few
percents as $k$ decreases (i.e., larger angular scales).

Furthermore, we take advantage of the EoR window and calculate the 1D
power spectrum by only averaging the modes inside the chosen EoR window.
As illustrated in \autoref{fig:ps1d}(b), the excision of wedge-shaped
contamination region has little effect on the power spectrum of the EoR
signal, but reduces the powers of all foreground components remarkably
as we would expect.
Nevertheless, the median power of radio halos can still be about one
tenth of the EoR signal at intermediate and large \kperp{} modes,
corresponding to angular scales of several arcminutes to sub-arcminute.
Due to the large fluctuations across sky regions, radio halos may
impose a contamination as strong as the EoR signal at those scales
inside the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence interval.
Consequently, we argue that radio halos worth a serious treatment in
the forthcoming deep surveys aiming at the EoR signal.
Given the large fluctuations of radio halos, it is advantageous to
identify the sky regions with as less radio halos and bright point
sources as possible for the future EoR observations by SKA1-Low as
well as other radio interferometers.
A clean sky region is of great significance as it can not only
greatly reduce the difficulties in calibrations and data analyses,
but also help achieve lower noise level and better measurement
precision and accuracy.
We are making use of the MWA GLEAM survey \citep{wayth2015}, other
archived radio surveys, and galaxy cluster catalogs from the X-ray and
optical bands to identify the clean sky regions, proposing the candidate
EoR regions for SKA1-Low (Zheng et al. in preparation).

    \textbf{(a)} Use all modes without applying the EoR window constraint;
    \textbf{(b)} Only use the modes inside the EoR window.
    The gray shaded regions represent the \SI{68}{\percent} confidence
    interval indicating the large fluctuations of radio halos across sky
    regions, and the gray solid line indicates the median power spectrum.
    The power spectrum of the typical radio halos example is shown as
    the red solid line, which agrees with the median power spectrum well.
    The magenta hatched region does not appear on the right sub-figure,
    because those modes were excised along with the foreground wedge.
  }
\end{figure*}

We also mark in \autoref{fig:ps1d} the power spectrum of the typical
example of radio halos, and it only has small deviation from the median
power spectrum, which confirms that our results presented above are
representative.
We note that the power spectrum of the diffuse Galactic emission has a
peak at $\kperp \sim \SI{1.0}{\per\Mpc}$, which is caused by the side-lobes
of Fourier transforming the finite frequency interval of the image cube;
although the Galactic foreground is very spectral-smooth, and the
Blackman-Nuttall window function is applied along the frequency dimension,
it can still produce strong side-lobes compared to the EoR signal.

%========================================================================
\subsection{Lower and Higher Frequency Bands}
\label{sec:freq-bands}
%========================================================================

In order to characterize the complete reionization process, it is essential
to measure the redshifted 21~cm signal among a broad frequency band
from about \SI{100}{\MHz} to \SI{200}{\MHz}, and all current and next
generation interferometers targeting the EoR measurements were designed
to have sufficient frequency coverage.
Here we choose another lower frequency band of \SIrange{120}{128}{\MHz}
and a higher band of \SIrange{192}{200}{\MHz}, which are commonly studied
in the literature as well, and follow the same simulation pipeline as
described in Sections \ref{sec:sky-simu} and \ref{sec:obs-simu} to
investigate the contributions of radio halos at these different
frequencies.
At \SI{124}{\MHz}, the middle of the former band, the mean (r.m.s.)
brightness temperature of the simulated sky maps for radio halos
(the same typical example mentioned in \autoref{sec:halos}),
Galactic synchrotron emission, Galactic free-free emission,
extragalactic point sources, and the EoR signal are

\SI{192}{\K} (\SI{2.97e5}{\K}), % point sources
\SI{13.5}{\mK} (\SI{14.4}{\mK}), % EoR
respectively.
Meanwhile, the mean (r.m.s.) brightness temperatures at
\SI{196}{\MHz} for these components are

\SI{14.4}{\K} (\SI{1.39e4}{\K}), % point sources
\SI{2.48}{\mK} (\SI{3.44}{\mK}), % EoR
respectively.

    The lines and shaded regions share the same styles as in
    \autoref{fig:ps1d}.

  }
\end{figure*}

We similarly calculate the 2D power spectrum ratios of radio halos to the
EoR signal at these two bands, as shown in \autoref{fig:ps2d-ratio-bands}.
Because of FoV $\propto f^{-1}$ with $f$ being the observation frequency,
we use $\Theta_{124} = \SI{7.5}{\degree}$ and
$\Theta_{196} = \SI{4.8}{\degree}$ as well as $e = 3$ to define the EoR
window boundaries for the lower and higher frequency bands, respectively.
In addition, we compute the 1D power spectra for all the components as well
as all the simulation runs of radio halos in order to account for the sky
fluctuations, and show the results in \autoref{fig:ps1d-bands}.
As radio halos are much brighter toward to lower frequencies, while the
intensity of the EoR signal only varies a little, it is evident that radio
halos become a much severer contamination to the EoR detection at the
lower frequency band, comparing to the results at \SIrange{154}{162}{\MHz}
as depicted in Figures~\ref{fig:ps2d-ratio}(a) and \ref{fig:ps1d}.
Although applied the EoR window constraint, radio halos can typically be
as strong as or even stronger than the EoR signal at intermediate and
large $\kperp$ modes, causing great difficulties in EoR measurements.
At the higher frequency band, the power of radio halos is generally
$\lesssim \SI{1}{\percent}$ of the EoR signal and hence radio halos
only have a very limited impact on the EoR detection, compared to the
situations at lower frequencies as described above and in \autoref{sec:ps1d}.

During the EoR, the intensity of 21~cm signal first increases as the
reionization continues, but later decreases to almost zero as the \Hi{}
is gradually ionized.
In our adopted EoR simulation as mentioned in \autoref{sec:eor-signal},
the 21~cm signal peaks at about \SIrange{120}{130}{\MHz} \citep{mesinger2016}.
However, radio halos continue to be brighter toward lower frequencies
and therefore become an important foreground contamination, which should
be taken care of in order to accurately measure the 21~cm signal at such
low frequencies.

%========================================================================
\subsection{Frequency Structures}
\label{sec:freq-structures}
%========================================================================

The smoothness along the frequency dimension is the most important feature
of various foreground components, and is very crucial to enable us to
extract the faint EoR signal in the presence of overwhelming foreground
contamination.
However, spurious frequency structures may present in the final image
cubes due to calibration uncertainties, instrumental and observational
effects (e.g., cable signal reflections, ionospheric distortions),
which break the spectral smoothness of the foreground emission, and
throw the foreground power to high-\klos{} modes into the EoR window,
corrupting the EoR measurements.
There are some simulation studies and observational analyses showing that
the chromatic instrumental response and insufficient foreground modeling
can lead to small calibration errors of about
\SIrange[range-units=repeat]{0.1}{1}{\percent}
\citep[e.g.,][]{barry2016,beardsley2016,ewallWice2017}.

To take the spurious frequency structures into account, we adjust each
slice of the image cube by multiplying with a random number drawn from a
Gaussian distribution with unity mean \citep{chapman2016}.
Two cases are considered, one is to mimic a \SI{0.1}{\percent} variation
in the frequency dimension by using a sigma of 0.001 for the Gaussian
distribution, the other is a frequency variation of \SI{1}{\percent}
with Gaussian sigma of 0.01.
Then we calculate the 1D power spectra from the modified image cubes,
and repeat the process 100 times to estimate the uncertainties that
frequency structures may cause.
We show in \autoref{fig:ps1d-bands-crp} the 1D power spectra of radio
halos and the EoR signal with variations been added along the frequency
dimension for the \SIrange{154}{162}{\MHz} band.
The 1D power spectrum of the EoR signal does not have noticeable changes
regardless of the amplitude of frequency variations being either
\SI{0.1}{\percent} or \SI{1}{\percent} as well as whether the EoR window
constraint is applied, since the EoR signal already fluctuates rapidly
along the frequency dimension.
While the 1D power spectrum of radio halos remains almost unchanged
without the EoR window constraint, the power spectrum inside the EoR
window increases by more than 10 times and exceeds that of the EoR
signal at large-$k$ modes when frequency variations of \SI{1}{\percent}
present.
The reason is that most of the powers of radio halos distribute within
the wedge-shaped region mainly consisting of angular (\kperp) modes,
thus the frequency (\klos) powers, even with the added power caused by
the frequency variations, cannot have a noticeable influence on the
final averaged 1D powers without excising the contaminating wedge.
If the amplitude of frequency variations reduces to \SI{0.1}{\percent},
the 1D power spectrum of radio halos inside the EoR window increases
only slightly, which will not add more difficulties to EoR measurements.
Considering that radio halos are typically 2 orders of magnitude weaker
than point sources as shown in \autoref{fig:ps1d},
this result is also consistent with the findings of \citet{barry2016},
who recommended that EoR instruments should have no spectral features
larger than \SI{\sim e-5} in the antenna or receiver system with spectral
scales smaller than \SI{\sim 8}{\MHz}.

\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}
%########################################################################

In this work, we have simulated the contribution of radio halos in galaxy
cluster to the low-frequency sky, and quantitatively evaluated the impacts
on the EoR measurements imposed by radio halos.
We have developed the \texttt{FG21sim} software to simulate the low-frequency
radio sky, including the contributions of the Galactic synchrotron and
free-free emission, extragalactic point sources, and radio halos in
galaxy clusters.
Among these, we significantly improved the modeling of radio halos by
employing the merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration model, which can
fully describe the emergence and evolution of radio halos.
The model parameters were further calibrated by utilizing all currently
observed radio halos, achieving good agreement between the simulation
results and observation data.
Adopting the latest SKA1-Low layout configuration, we input the simulated
sky maps into \texttt{OSKAR} to perform observational simulation, which
were then imaged through \texttt{WSClean}, yielding the \enquote{observed}
images with the instrumental effects properly incorporated.

Focused on the \SIrange{154}{162}{\MHz} frequency band, we calculated
and compared the 2D and 1D power spectra of radio halos, the EoR signal,
diffuse Galactic emission, and extragalactic point sources.
The 2D power spectrum of radio halos shows clearly the wedge-shaped
contaminating region, dominating the intermediate and large \kperp{}
modes ($\SI{0.2}{\per\Mpc} \leq \kperp \leq \SI{1.0}{\per\Mpc}$,
corresponding to \SIrange[range-units=repeat]{2.4}{12}{\arcminute})
over the diffuse Galactic emission, and reaches several percents of the
power of point sources at those scales.
If we derive the 1D power spectra by naively averaging over all the
available modes, radio halos can typically be about 3 order of magnitude
stronger than the EoR signal due to the serious contamination from the
foreground wedge.
%% rewrite/improve...
By applying the EoR window constraint, only the modes inside the EoR
window are used to derive the 1D power spectra.
While the powers of the EoR signal barely change, the powers of radio
halos are substantially reduced by about 4 orders of magnitude, hence
only has limited influence on the EoR measurements.
However, radio halos vary significantly across sky regions, leading to
large fluctuations in the contamination to the EoR window, which can be
as strong as or even stronger than the target signal, therefore
selecting clean sky regions avoiding radio halos and bright point sources
as much as possible for the future deep EoR observations is of great
importance (Zheng et al. in preparation).

We also investigated in the lower \SIrange{120}{128}{\MHz} and the higher
\SIrange{192}{200}{\MHz} frequency bands, and found that radio halos
produced severer contamination to the EoR measurements at the lower
frequencies, because the EoR signal peaks at about \SIrange{120}{130}{\MHz},
while radio halos continue to be brighter toward lower frequencies.
The contamination situation by radio halos at the higher
\SIrange{192}{200}{\MHz} is similar to the situation at
\SIrange{154}{162}{\MHz}.
Moreover, the possible frequency structures resulting from calibration
errors and instrumental and observational effects were discussed by
adding variations to the image cubes along the frequency dimension.
Utilizing the 1D power spectra derived inside the EoR window, the added
frequency variations have little influence on the EoR signal, but increase
the powers of radio halos by about 10 times (\SI{1}{\percent} frequency
variations), imposing a serious contamination to the EoR measurements.
Our results show that frequency variations of amplitude \SI{0.1}{\percent}
is acceptable for radio halos to not cause significant difficulties in
EoR measurements.

Nevertheless the EoR window provide a powerful method to avoid the
overwhelming foreground and lead us to a promising prospect in EoR
measurements, the foreground avoidance method loses many Fourier modes
which account for a large portion of the EoR powers, restricting the
measurable EoR modes and compromising the measurement precision.
Therefore, sophisticated foreground modeling and removal methods are
still an active research field.
Among the various foreground components, we argue that radio halos
should be dealt with seriously for the forthcoming deep EoR surveys.
Better understanding and characterizing various foreground components
help subtract them more accurately, expanding the EoR window and
revealing more modes for more robust EoR measurements.

In a flat \lcdm{} cosmology as we adopted in this work, the critical linear
overdensity as a function of redshift $z$ is \citep{kitayama1996,randall2002}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-crit}
  \delta_c(z) = \frac{D(z=0)}{D(z)}
  \left[ \frac{3 (12\pi)^{2/3}}{20} \right]
  \left[1 + 0.0123 \log_{10} \Omega_f(z) \right],
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_f(z)$ is the mass density ratio at redshift $z$ defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:omega-fz}
  \Omega_f(z) = \frac{\Omega_m(1+z)^3}{\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}},
\end{equation}
and $D(z)$ is the growth factor given by \citep[Equation~(13.6)]{peebles1980}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth-factor}
  D(x) = \frac{(x^3 + 2)^{1/2}}{x^{3/2}}
    \int_0^x y^{3/2} (y^3 + 2)^{-3/2} \,\D{y},
\end{equation}
with $x_0 \equiv (2\Omega_{\Lambda}/\Omega_m)^{1/3}$ and $x = x_0 / (1+z)$.

The virial radius of a galaxy cluster is defined as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:radius-virial}
  r_{\R{vir}} = \left[
    \frac{3 M^{\R{cl}}}{4\pi \Delta_{\R{vir}}(z) \rho_{\R{crit}}(z)}
  \right]^{1/3},
\end{equation}
where $M^{\R{cl}}$ is the total mass (i.e., virial mass) of the cluster,
$\rho_{\R{crit}}(z) = 3 H^2(z) / (8\pi G)$ is the critical density
at redshift $z$,
and $\Delta_{\R{vir}}(z)$ is the average overdensity of the cluster
at redshift $z$ given by \citep{kitayama1996,cassano2005}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-vir}
  \Delta_{\R{vir}}(z) = 18\pi^2 \left[ 1 + 0.4093 \, w(z)^{0.9052} \right],
\end{equation}
where $w(z) \equiv \Omega_f^{-1}(z) - 1$.
