\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%########################################################################

{\color{magenta}
The Epoch of Reionization (EoR; $z \sim \numrange{6}{15}$) refers to
a period of our Universe preceded
by the Cosmic Dawn ($z \sim \numrange{15}{30}$) and the Dark Ages
($z \sim \numrange{30}{200}$).
}
During the EoR, which is expected to last from about 300 million to
about 1 billion years after the Big Bang, the reionization of
neutral hydrogen (\Hi) caused primarily by the ultra-violet and soft
X-ray photons emitted from the first generation celestial objects
efficiently surpassed the cooling of the gas through
recombination of electrons and protons.
As a result, the majority of baryonic matter was again in a
highly ionized state.
Comparing with the observations of distant quasars and cosmic microwave
background (CMB), which have provided some loose constraints on the
reionization process, the detection the redshifted 21~cm line emission
from \Hi{} in \SIrange{\sim 50}{200}{\MHz}, especially those from the
adjacent regions of the ionized bubbles,
is recognized to be the decisive tool to directly reveal the EoR
\citep[see][for reviews]{zaroubi2013rev,furlanetto2016rev}.

In order to probe the EoR, a number of radio interferometers
working at the low-frequency radio bands, such as
the Square Kilometre Array (SKA; \citealt{mellema2013rev,koopmans2015rev}),
the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA; \citealt{deboer2017}),
{\color{magenta}
and their pathfinders [e.g.,
the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR; \citealt{vanHaarlem2013});
the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA; \citealt{bowman2013,tingay2013});
the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization
(PAPER; \citealt{parsons2010});
the 21 CentiMeter Array (21CMA; \citealt{zheng2016})]
}
have been designed to target the redshifted 21~cm signals.
The challenges met in these experiments, however, are immense
due to a variety of complicated instrumental effects,
ionospheric distortions, radio frequency interference, and the
strong celestial foreground contamination, which overwhelms the
redshifted 21~cm signals by \numrange{4}{5} orders of magnitude
\citep[see][for a review]{morales2010rev}.

Among various contaminating foreground components, the Galactic diffuse
radiation (including both the synchrotron and free-free emissions)
and extragalactic point sources are the most prominent and contribute
the majority of the foreground
\citep[e.g.,][]{shaver1999,diMatteo2004,gleser2008,liu2012,murray2017}.
At about \SI{150}{\MHz}, it is estimated that they may account for
about \SI{71}{\percent} and \SI{27}{\percent} of the total foreground,
respectively \citep{shaver1999}.
Most of the remaining foreground arises from the synchrotron emission
from the extragalactic diffuse sources that include the large-scale
filaments embedded in the cosmic webs,
the intergalactic medium located at the cluster outskirts (virial shocks),
and the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters (radio halos,
radio relics, and mini-halos).
Although these sources play a minor role and have been less constrained
by observations, an appropriate treatment of them is indispensable
in detecting the very faint EoR signals, since they may still be
{\color{magenta}
tens to hundreds of times brighter than the target signals
\citep[e.g.,][]{waxman2000,diMatteo2004,gleser2008}.
As estimated in \citet{diMatteo2004}, the intensity fluctuation
at \SI{115}{\MHz} contributed by extended radio halos and relics
is about three orders of magnitude larger than that of 21~cm signals
through the whole range of angular scales.
}

In this work, we attempt to address this issue by focusing on the
evolution of diffuse radio halos in galaxy clusters via detailed
modeling and their impacts on detecting the EoR signals.
First discovered in the Coma cluster \citep{large1959}, radio halos
has been observed in about 80 merging galaxy clusters roughly at
their centers, showing relatively regular morphologies and spatial
extensions of $\sim\,$\si{\Mpc}, as well as an obvious correlation
with the X-ray-emitting ICM \citep[e.g.,][]{cassano2013}.
It should be noted that the angular sizes of radio halos happen to be
several to tens of arcminutes, which coincides with those theoretically
predicted for the ionizing bubbles during the EoR.
This, complemented with the potentially large number
{\color{magenta}(several to tens of thousands in all the sky)}
of radio halos to be revealed by the forthcoming
low-frequency radio telescopes \citep[e.g.,][]{cassano2015},
indicates that in order to better guide foreground removal and avoidance
techniques, it is essential to investigate the cumulative emission
of radio halos as a source of the foreground contamination
\citep[e.g.,][]{diMatteo2004,gleser2008}
\LI{Di Matteo et al. 2004 一文研究了河外展源，主要是射电晕和射电遗迹；
但该文章有点老了，有些方法和结果现在已经有点不适用了}.
As of today, however, only few works have been dedicated to this topic
based on relatively straightforward modeling methods,
{\color{magenta}
e.g., using the \SI{1.4}{\GHz} radio flux function or radio--X-ray
scaling relations, which are barely constrained by current observations
\citep[e.g.,][]{gleser2008,jelic2008}.
}
The data acquired in these observations are far from complete due to
the lack of systematic surveys targeting these diffuse sources,
especially in the low-frequency radio bands \citep[e.g.,][]{kale2016rev}.

This paper is prepared as follows.
In \autoref{sec:sky-simu} we introduce our new open-source software
\texttt{FG21sim} and use it to simulate the low-frequency radio sky,
among which a detailed simulation of radio halos in galaxy clusters has
been developed by applying the merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration
model.
In \autoref{sec:obs-simu} we employ the latest SKA1-Low layout
configuration to incorporate the practical instrumental effects into
the simulated sky maps.
We then quantitatively evaluate the contamination of radio halos to the
EoR signals and discuss the results in \autoref{sec:results}.
Finally we summarize our work in \autoref{sec:summary}.
Throughout this work we adopt a flat \lcdm{} cosmology with
$H_0 = \SI{100}{\hubble} = \SI{71}{\km\per\second\per\Mpc}$,
$\Omega_m = 0.27$, $\Omega_{\Lambda} = 1 - \Omega_m = 0.73$,
$\Omega_b = 0.046$, $n_s = 0.96$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.81$.

\section{Simulation of Low-Frequency Radio Sky}
\label{sec:sky-simu}
%########################################################################

Based on our previous works \citep{wang2010,wang2013}, we have used the
Python programming language to develop the \texttt{FG21sim} software to
simulate the realistic low-frequency radio sky by taking into account the
contributions of our Galaxy, extragalactic point sources, and radio halos
in galaxy clusters.
Our software is open-sourced under the MIT License and is available at
\url{https://github.com/liweitianux/fg21sim},
where further documents and auxiliary data are provided.
Additional utilities are also developed to help the observational simulation,
which aims to integrate the instrumental responses of low-frequency radio
interferometers, as well as subsequent analyzing procedures.
%%%
\XU{The software is designed to take into account the
contributions of our Galaxy, extragalactic discrete sources (i.e.,
star-forming galaxies, radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and
radio-loud AGNs), galaxy clusters, cosmic microwave background (CMB), and 21
cm signals of the EoR【既然是天空仿真，就不要有遗漏！！确认还缺什么！！】,
and it also has an interface to integrate instrumental responses of any
low-frequency radio interferometers.}

By consulting the latest SKA science book on the EoR survey strategies
\citep[e.g.,][]{koopmans2015rev}, we perform the simulations within
a \SI{8}{\MHz} band centered at \SI{158}{\MHz} for a
\SI[product-units=repeat]{10 x 10}{\degree}
sky region at (R.A., Dec.) = (\SI{0}{\degree}, \SI{-27}{\degree}),
which locates at high galactic latitude ($b = \SI{-78.5}{\degree}$)
and passes through the zenith of SKA1-Low\footnote{%
  This sky region is also targeted by the MWA (EoR0 field;
  e.g., \citealt{beardsley2016}).}.
%%%
\XU{It has also been observed with MWA (EoR0 field), which enables us to us actual data to constrain our simulations.}
\LI{此工作没有如此使用 MWA 的观测来约束模拟图像}
%%%
The \SI{8}{\MHz} bandwidth is chosen to limit the cosmological evolution
effect for the 21~cm signals when calculating power spectra
\citep[e.g.][]{wyithe2004,thyagarajan2013},
and the relatively large region of \SI[product-units=repeat]{10 x 10}{\degree}
will cover the first side-lobe, which helps the image CLEAN procedure
in \autoref{sec:obs-simu}.
The simulated sky is pixelized into \num{1800 x 1800} with a pixel size
of \SI{20}{\arcsecond}.


%========================================================================
\subsection{Radio Halos in Galaxy Clusters}
\label{sec:cluster-halo}
%========================================================================

As a significant improvement over our past works, we consider in detail
the evolution of radio halos in galaxy clusters by employing the
{\color{magenta}
merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration model, among which the
relativistic electrons are re-accelerated in the ICM via the second-order
Fermi process by the turbulence generated in merger events,
and also lose energies due to mechanisms including synchrotron radiation,
inverse Compton scattering off the CMB photons, and Coulomb collisions
with the thermal ICM.
For each galaxy cluster, we first simulate its merging history, which is
quantitatively described by a merger tree, by using the extended
Press-Schechter theory.
}
Then we calculate the turbulent acceleration efficiency and duration
for each merger event.
By combining the effects of turbulent acceleration and energy loss,
we obtain the temporal evolution of the relativistic electron spectrum,
and therefore the synchrotron emission and image of the radio halo.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Mass Function}
\label{sec:distributions}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Press-Schechter formalism was originally advanced as one of the standard
method to predict the mass function of galaxy clusters and its evolution
in the Universe \citep{press1974}, and has been extended to combine with
the cold dark matter (CDM) models \citep[e.g.,][]{bond1991,lacey1993}.
The number density (i.e., the number per unit comoving volume per unit
mass) of dark matter halos (i.e., galaxy clusters) at a certain redshift
$z$ is predicted by the Press-Schechter mass function \citep{press1974}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ps-mass-func}
  n(M, z) \,\D{M} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \frac{\langle{\rho}\rangle}{M}
  \frac{\delta_c(z)}{\sigma^2(M)} \left| \diff{\sigma(M)}{M} \right|
  \exp\!\left[ -\frac{\delta_c^2(z)}{2\sigma^2(M)} \right] \D{M},
\end{equation}
where
$M = (1 - f_{\R{gas}}) M_{\R{cl}} = (1 - \Omega_b/\Omega_m) M_{\R{cl}}$
is the dark matter halo mass with $M_{\R{cl}}$ the cluster mass,
$\langle {\rho} \rangle$ is the current mean density of the Universe,
$\delta_c(z)$ is the critical linear overdensity for a region to collapse
at redshift $z$ [see \autoref{eq:delta-crit}],
and $\sigma(M)$ is the current r.m.s. (root-mean-square) density fluctuations
within a sphere of mean mass $M$.

Considering the CDM model and the halo mass range covered by galaxy
clusters, it is reasonable to adopt such a power-law distribtuion
for the density perturbations \citep{sarazin2002,randall2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:sigma-mass}
  \sigma(M) = \sigma_8 \left( \frac{M}{M_8} \right)^{-\alpha},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_8$ is the present-day rms density fluctuations on a
scale of \SI{8}{\per\hubble\Mpc},
$M_8 = (4\pi/3)(8 \,\si{\per\hubble\Mpc})^3 \langle{\rho}\rangle$
is the mass contained in a sphere of a radius \SI{8}{\per\hubble\Mpc},
and the exponent $\alpha = (n+3)/6$ is related to the fluctuations
pattern whose power spectrum varies with wavenumber $k$ as $k^n$.
Here we follow \citet{randall2002} and adopt $n = -7/5$.

Then, by placing a conservative minimum cluster mass cut of
$M_{\R{min}} = \SI{e14}{\solarmass}$ and a maximum redshift cut
at $z_{\R{max}} = 4$, we are able to use \autoref{eq:ps-mass-func}
to calculate both the total number and the distribution of galaxy
clusters for any given sky patch.
The mass $M_{\R{obs}}$, redshift $z_{\R{obs}}$, and sky position of
each simulated galaxy cluster can be randomly sampled using the
Monte Carlo method \citep{wang2010}.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Merging History}
\label{sec:merging-history}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

Galaxy clusters are formed hierarchically by accretion and merging from
smaller clusters, groups, and galaxies.
The extended Press-Schechter theory outlined in \citet{lacey1993} provide
us with a way to simulate the growth history of a cluster (i.e., merger tree).
For each merger tree to be built, we start with the cluster's current
mass $M_{\R{obs}}$ and redshift $z_{\R{obs}}$, which are randomly sampled
from the mass function in \autoref{sec:distributions}.
We trace the growth history of this cluster back in time by running
Monte Carlo simulations to randomly determine the mass change
$\Delta M$ at each step, which may be regarded
either as a merger event (if $\Delta M > \Delta M_c$)
or as an accretion event (if $\Delta M \leq \Delta M_c$).
We choose $\Delta M_c = \SI{e13}{\solarmass}$ to focus on the major mergers
with which radio halos are associated,
and we only trace the merging history of the main cluster,
which are sufficient for this work.

We assume that during each growth step the cluster mass increases from
$M_1$ at time $t_1$ (earlier) to $M_2$ at $t_2$ (later).
Given $M_2$ and $t_2$, the conditional probability of the cluster had
a progenitor being in the mass range $M_1 \to M_1 + \D{M_1}$ at an
earlier time $t_1$ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eps-condprob}
  \R{Pr}(M_1, t_1 | M_2, t_2) \,\D{M_1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
\frac{M_2}{M_1}
  \frac{\delta_{c1} - \delta_{c2}}{(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2)^{3/2}}
  \left| \diff{\sigma_1^2}{M_1} \right|
  \exp \!\left[ -\frac{(\delta_{c1} - \delta_{c2})^2}
    {2(\sigma_1^2 - \sigma_2^2)} \right] \D{M_1},
\end{equation}
where
$\delta_{ci} \equiv \delta_c(t_i)$, $\sigma_i \equiv \sigma(M_i)$, and $i =
1, 2$ is used to denote parameters defined at time $t_1$ and $t_2$,
respectively \citep{lacey1993,randall2002}.
By further introducing $S \equiv \sigma^2(M)$ and
$\omega \equiv \delta_c(t)$, this equation reduces to
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eps-condprob-simp}
  \R{Pr}(\Delta S, \Delta \omega) \,\D{\Delta S} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}
  \frac{\Delta\omega}{(\Delta S)^{3/2}}
  \exp \!\left[ -\frac{(\Delta\omega)^2}{2 \Delta S} \right] \D{\Delta S}.
\end{equation}

During the backward tracing of a cluster, the step size $\Delta\omega$
is chosen adaptively as \citep{randall2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:dw-step}
  (\Delta\omega)_{\R{step}} \lesssim \frac{1}{2} \left[
    S \left| \diff{\ln \sigma^2}{\ln M} \right|
    \left( \frac{\Delta M_c}{M} \right) \right]^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the cluster mass at the corresponding step.
In order to obey the probability distribution of mergers with different
mass changes (i.e., $\Delta S$),
we sample the cumulative probability distribution of the sub-cluster masses
to determine $\Delta S$ (i.e., $\Delta M$) at each step:
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:cdf-sub-masses}
  \R{Pr}(<\!\Delta S, \Delta\omega) =
  \int_0^{\Delta S} \R{Pr}(\Delta S', \Delta\omega) \,\D{\Delta S'} =
  \erfc \!\left( \frac{\Delta \omega}{\sqrt{2 \Delta S}} \right),
\end{equation}
where $\erfc(x) = 1 - \erf(x)$ is the complementary error function.
With a random $\Delta S$ (i.e., $M_{\R{sub}}$) drawn from this probability
distribution, the mass of the cluster's progenitor $M_1$ is obtained from
$S_1 = S_2 + \Delta S$.

Considering that radio halos are associated to recent major mergers and
have a lifetime $\tau_{\R{halo}} \lesssim \SI{1}{\Gyr}$
\citep[e.g.,][]{brunetti2009,cassano2016},
we only trace the cluster merging history to a maximum backward time of
\SI{3}{\Gyr}.
Then for each cluster we extract the properties of all the merger events
for the following radio halo simulation.


%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Radio Halo Emergence and Evolution}
\label{sec:halos}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the adopted merger-induced turbulence re-acceleration model, there
exists a population of primary (or fossil) high-energy electrons permeating
the ICM, which are thought to be injected by active galactic nucleus (AGN)
activities (quasars, radio galaxies, etc.), and by star formation in
normal galaxies (supernovae, galactic winds, etc.) during the cluster
life \citep[see][for a review]{blasi2007rev},
then the turbulence generated by intense mergers interact with the ICM
and accelerate the primary electrons to be highly relativistic, resulting
in the observed diffuse synchrotron radiation.

Besides the turbulent acceleration, electrons in the ICM can loss energies
via synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering off the CMB photons,
Coulomb collisions, etc. \citep{sarazin1999}.
Given a population of electrons with isotropic energy distribution, and
considering both the energy gain and loss mechanisms, the time evolution
of the electron spectrum is governed by the following Fokker-Planck
diffusion-advection equation \citep{eilek1991,schlickeiser2002}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fokkerplanck}
  \pdiff{n(\gamma,t)}{t} = \pdiff{}{\gamma} \left[ n(\gamma,t) \left(
      \left| \diff{\gamma}{t} \right| -
      \frac{2}{\gamma} D_{\gamma\gamma}(\gamma, t) \right) \right] +
    \pdiff{}{\gamma} \left[ D_{\gamma\gamma} \pdiff{n(\gamma,t)}{\gamma}
    \right] + Q_e(\gamma,t),
\end{equation}
where $\gamma \approx p / (m_e c)$ is the Lorentz factor of electrons,
$n(\gamma, t)$ is the isotropic number density of the electron population,
$D_{\gamma\gamma}(\gamma, t)$ is the diffusion coefficient describing
the interactions between the turbulence and electrons,
$|\R{d}\gamma / \R{d}t|$ is the energy loss rate,
and $Q_e(\gamma, t)$ describes the electron injection.

\setcounter{sssseccount}{0}
\ssssec{Electron Injection}
%%%

It is reasonable to assume that the primary electrons were constantly
injected into the ICM during the cluster life and had a power-law
spectrum of index $s \sim 2.3$ \citep[e.g.,][]{sarazin1999}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:electron-inj}
  Q_e(\gamma, t) \equiv Q_e(\gamma) = K_e \,\gamma^{-s}.
\end{equation}
By further assuming that the total energy of injected electrons is a
fraction, $\eta_e$, of the total thermal energy \citep{cassano2005}
\begin{equation}
  \epsilon_e \,\tau_{\R{cl}} \int_{\gamma_{\R{min}}}^{\gamma_{\R{max}}}
  Q_e(\gamma') \gamma' \,\D{\gamma'}
  = \eta_e \,\epsilon_{\R{th}},
\end{equation}
and given $\gamma_{\R{min}} \ll \gamma_{\R{\max}}$,
the injection rate $K_e$ can be derived to be
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:injrate}
  K_e \simeq \frac{(s-2)\,\eta_e\,\epsilon_{\R{th}}}{\epsilon_e\,\tau_{\R{cl}}}
    \gamma_{\R{min}}^{s-2},
\end{equation}
where $\tau_{\R{cl}} \simeq t_{\R{obs}}$ is the cluster's age at the
\enquote{observed} redshift $z_{\R{obs}}$ as simulated in \autoref{sec:distributions},
and $\epsilon_e = m_e c^2$ is the electron's still energy.
In addition, the thermal energy density of the ICM, $\epsilon_{\R{th}}$,
is calculated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy-density-thermal}
  \epsilon_{\R{th}} = \frac{3}{2} \,n_{\R{th}} \,k_BT_{\R{cl}},
\end{equation}
and the thermal number density, $n_{\R{th}}$, is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:number-density-thermal}
  n_{\R{th}} \simeq \frac{3 f_{\R{gas}} M_{\R{vir}}}{4\pi \mu m_u \,r^3_{\R{vir}}},
\end{equation}
where
$r_{\R{vir}}$ is the cluster's virial radius,
the cluster mean temperature is approximated with the virial temperature:
$k_BT_{\R{cl}} \simeq k_BT_{\R{vir}} = G M_{\R{vir}} \,\mu m_u / (2 r_{\R{vir}})$,
$f_{\R{gas}} \simeq \Omega_b/\Omega_m$ is the gas fraction assumed
for clusters, $\mu \simeq 0.6$ is the mean molecular weight
\citep[e.g.,][]{ettori2013}, and $m_u$ is the atomic mass unit.

As for the initial spectrum of electrons for solving
\autoref{eq:fokkerplanck}, it is derived by evolving the accumulated spectrum
$n_e'(\gamma) = t_0 K_e \gamma^{-s}$ for \SI{\sim 1}{\Gyr} with only energy
losses, where $t_0$ is the cosmic age when the first merger event begins
\citep[e.g.,][]{brunetti2007}.

%%%
\ssssec{Turbulent Acceleration}
%%%

The interaction details between the turbulence and the cluster ICM
are complicated and still poorly understood.
Among the several different particle acceleration mechanisms could be
potentially triggered by the turbulence, the most important one is that
the turbulence dissipates its energy and accelerates particles by interacting
with the relativistic particles (e.g., cosmic rays) in the ICM via the
transit time damping process
\citep[and references therein]{brunetti2007,brunetti2011},
and the associated diffusion coefficient is given as
\citep{pinzke2017,miniati2015}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:dpp}
  D_{\gamma\gamma} = \gamma^2 \frac{4\pi \zeta}{X_{\R{CR}} L_{\R{turb}}}
    \frac{\langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle^2}{c_s^3},
\end{equation}
where
$\zeta \sim \numrange{0.1}{0.3}$ is an efficiency factor characterizing
the plasma instabilities (e.g., due to spatial or temporal intermittency),
$X_{\R{CR}} = \epsilon_{\R{CR}} / \epsilon_{\R{th}} \sim \SI{1}{\percent}$
is the relative energy density of cosmic rays with respect to the thermal ICM,
$L_{\R{turb}} \simeq r_{\R{vir}}/3$ is the turbulence injection scale with
$r_{\R{vir}}$ the virial radius of the merged cluster \citep{miniati2015},
$\langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle$ is the turbulence velocity dispersion,
and $c_s$ is the sound speed in the ICM.

The total kinetic energy carried by a merger can be estimated as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy-merger}
  E_{\R{merger}} = \frac{1}{2} f_{\R{gas}} M_{\R{sub}} v^2_{\R{sub}}
    \simeq \frac{1}{2} f_{\R{gas}} M_{\R{sub}} \frac{G M_{\R{main}}}{r^2_{\R{main}}},
\end{equation}
where $M_{\R{main}}$ and $r_{\R{main}}$ are the virial mass and virial
radius of the main cluster, respectively.
To further estimate the velocity dispersion of the turbulence, we assume
that a fraction, $\eta_{\R{turb}}$, of the merger kinetic energy was
transferred into turbulent waves, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:energy-turb}
  E_{\R{turb}} = \frac{1}{2} M_{\R{turb}} \langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle
    = \eta_{\R{turb}} E_{\R{merger}},
\end{equation}
where
$M_{\R{turb}}$ is the gas mass enclosed in the turbulent region, i.e.,
within radius of $L_{\R{turb}}$.
By adopting a NFW density profile \citep{navarro1997}, the distribution
of mass in units of the virial mass is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mass-dist-nfw}
  f_{\R{nfw}}(s) = \frac{M(s)}{M_{\R{vir}}} =
    \frac{\ln(1 + c s) - c s / (1 + c s)}{\ln(1 + c) - c / (1 + c)},
\end{equation}
where $s = r / r_{\R{vir}}$ is the normalized radius in units of the
virial radius, and $c \sim 5$ is the concentration parameter for
clusters \citep{lokas2001}.
Therefore we have
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:mass-turb}
  M_{\R{turb}} = f_{\R{gas}} M_{\R{merged}}(<L_{\R{turb}})
    = f_{\R{gas}} f_{\R{nfw}}(1/3) (M_{\R{main}} + M_{\R{sub}}),
\end{equation}
and by substituting this into \autoref{eq:energy-turb} we obtain
the turbulence velocity dispersion as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:turb-velocity-dispersion}
  \langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle =
    \frac{\eta_{\R{turb}}}{f_{\R{nfw}}(1/3)}
    \frac{M_{\R{sub}}}{M_{\R{main}} + M_{\R{sub}}}
    \frac{G M_{\R{main}}}{r^2_{\R{main}}}.
\end{equation}

Generally, the turbulence generated during major mergers is subsonic
with a Mach number of
$\mathcal{M}_{\R{turb}} = \sqrt{\langle (\delta{v_t})^2 \rangle} / c_s \sim \numrange{0.2}{0.5}$,
and its acceleration efficiency to electrons can be described by the
acceleration timescale (i.e., the reciprocal of the acceleration rate)
$\tau_{\R{acc}} = 4 D_{\gamma\gamma} / \gamma^2 \sim \SI{0.1}{\Gyr}$,
which is independent of the electron momentum.

%%%
\ssssec{Acceleration Periods}
%%%

The whole merger process may last for \SIrange{2}{3}{\Gyr}
\citep[e.g.,][]{tormen2004,cassano2016},
but only when the strong turbulence exists can the turbulent acceleration
become effective, which persists for a relatively short period of time:
$\tau_{\R{turb}} \simeq 2 L_{\R{turb}} / v_{\R{imp}}$,
where $v_{\R{imp}}$ is the relative impact velocity between the merging
clusters \citep{miniati2015}.
Starting from a sufficiently large distance with zero velocity,
the relative impact velocity of two merging clusters with mass
$M_{\R{main}}$ and $M_{\R{sub}}$ is given by \citep{sarazin2002,cassano2005}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:v-imp}
  v_{\R{imp}} \simeq \left[
    \frac{2G (M_{\R{main}} + M_{\R{sub}})}{r_{\R{main}}}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\eta_v} \right)\right]^{1/2},
\end{equation}
with $\eta_v \simeq 4 (1 + M_{\R{sub}}/M_{\R{main}})^{1/3}$.
Therefore, we estimate that major mergers generally have an effective
turbulent acceleration duration $\tau_{\R{turb}} \sim \SI{0.5}{\Gyr}$.

For each merger event
$(M^{(i)}_{\R{main}}, M^{(i)}_{\R{sub}}, t^{(i)}_{\R{merger}})$
of a galaxy cluster as simulated in \autoref{sec:merging-history},
we calculate the corresponding turbulent acceleration duration
$\tau^{(i)}_{\R{turb}}$, and solve the above Fokker-Planck equation with
turbulent acceleration turned on together with energy losses among
periods $[t^{(i)}_{\R{merger}}, t^{(i)}_{\R{merger}}+\tau^{(i)}_{\R{turb}}]$,
while there is no acceleration at other times.

%%%
\ssssec{Energy Losses}
%%%

There are several different mechanisms through which the relativistic
electrons in the ICM may lose energies \citep{sarazin1999},
and we consider the following three major mechanisms in our simulation.
The first one is the inverse Compton scattering off the CMB photons
whose energy loss rate is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eloss-ic}
  \left( \diff{\gamma}{t} \right)_{\R{IC}} =
    \num{-4.32e-4} \,\gamma^2 (1+z)^4
    \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}].
\end{equation}

Secondly, the relativistic electrons generate synchrotron radiation
and the loss rate is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eloss-syn}
  \left( \diff{\gamma}{t} \right)_{\R{syn}} =
    \num{-4.10e-5} \,\gamma^2 \left( \frac{B}{\SI{1}{\uG}} \right)^2
    \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}],
\end{equation}
where $B$ is the magnetic field strength in the ICM, which is assumed
to be uniform and has an energy density
$u_B = B^2 / (8\pi) = \eta_B \,\epsilon_{\R{th}}$,
with $\epsilon_{\R{th}}$ being the thermal energy density.

The last mechanism considered here is that electrons lose energy
by interacting with the thermal ICM via Coulomb collisions, which gives
the loss rate
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:eloss-coul}
  \left( \diff{\gamma}{t} \right)_{\R{Coul}} =
  \num{-3.79e4} \,n_{\R{th}} \left[ 1 +
    \frac{\ln(\gamma/n_{\R{th}})}{75} \right] \quad [\si{\per\Gyr}],
\end{equation}
where $n_{\R{th}}$ is the thermal number density
in units of [\si{\per\cm\cubed}].

The inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation dominate
energy losses at the high-energy regime (e.g., $\gamma > 1000$),
and Coulomb collisions are the main energy-loss mechanism for lower
energy electrons (e.g., $\gamma < 100$).
Therefore, at intermediate energies (e.g., $\gamma \sim 300$),
electrons have a very long lifetime and can accumulate in the ICM
as the cluster grows \citep{sarazin1999}, which may become the primary
electrons to be accelerated \emph{in situ} by turbulence.

%%%
\ssssec{Numerical Method}
%%%

Now with all the coefficients in \autoref{eq:fokkerplanck} been determined,
we can evolve the initial electron spectrum $n_e(\gamma,\, t=t_0)$ via
solving this Fokker-Planck equation, and derive the \enquote{current}
electron spectrum $n_e(\gamma,\, t=t_{\R{obs}})$, which corresponds to the
\enquote{observed} redshift $z_{\R{obs}}$ as simulated in \autoref{sec:distributions}.
An efficient numerical method proposed by \citet{chang1970} is utilized
to solve the equation, under the no-flux boundary condition \citep{park1996}.
However, to avoid unphysical pile-up of electrons around the lower boundary,
we define a \enquote{buffer} region below $\gamma_{\R{buf}}$, within which
the spectral data are replaced by extrapolating from the data above
$\gamma_{\R{buf}}$ as a power-law spectrum \citep{donnert2014}.
We adopt a logarithmic grid for $\gamma \in [1, 10^5]$ with 200 cells,
and let the lower buffer region span 10 cells.

%%%
\ssssec{Image Generation}
%%%

After deriving the \enquote{current} electron spectrum
$n_e(\gamma, t_{\R{obs}})$, the synchrotron emissivity at frequency
$\nu$ is given by \citep{rybicki1979}
\begin{equation}
  \label{sec:jnu-sync}
  % unit: [erg/s/Hz/cm^3]
  J_{\R{syn}}(\nu) = \frac{\sqrt{3} \, e^3 B}{m_e c^2}
    \int_{\gamma_{\R{min}}}^{\gamma_{\R{max}}} \!\!\int_0^{\pi/2}
    n_e(\gamma, t_{\R{obs}}) F(\nu/\nu_c)
    \sin^2 \!\theta \,\D{\theta} \,\D{\gamma},
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ is the pitch angle of electrons,
and $F(\nu/\nu_c) = (\nu/\nu_c) \int_{\nu/\nu_c}^{\infty} K_{5/3}(x) \,\D{x}$
is the synchrotron kernel,
with $K_{5/3}(x)$ the modified Bessel function of 5/3 order,
$\nu_c = (3/2) \,\gamma^2 \nu_L \sin\theta
= 3 e B \gamma^2 \sin\theta / (4\pi m_e c)$
the electron's critical frequency.
The \enquote{observed} radio halo is assumed to be the same size as
the turbulent region \citep[e.g.,][]{vazza2011}:
$r_{\R{halo}} \simeq L_{\R{turb}} \simeq r_{\R{vir}}/3$,
therefore its radio power at a specific frequency (i.e., spectral power) is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-power}
  % unit: [W/Hz]
  P(\nu) = \frac{4\pi}{3} r_{\R{halo}}^3 J_{\R{syn}}(\nu),
\end{equation}
and the flux density measured at frequency $\nu$ is \citep[e.g.,][]{hogg1999}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-flux}
  % unit: [Jy] = 1e-26 [W/Hz/m^2]
  S(\nu) = \frac{(1+z_{\R{obs}}) P(\nu(1+z_{\R{obs}}))}{4\pi D_{\!L}^2(z_{\R{obs}})},
\end{equation}
where $D_{\!L}(z_{\R{obs}})$ is the luminosity distance to the halo at
redshift $z_{\R{obs}}$.

To generate the image for the simulated radio halos, we adopt an exponential
profile for the azimuthally averaged brightness distribution \citep{murgia2009}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:halo-profile}
  I_{\nu}(\theta) = I_{\nu,0} \exp(-3 \,\theta / \theta_{\R{halo}}),
\end{equation}
where $\theta = r / D_{\!A}(z_{\R{obs}})$ is the angular radius from the halo
center with $D_{\!A}(z_{\R{obs}})$ the angular diameter distance to the halo,
and $I_{\nu,0} = 9 S(\nu) / (2\pi \theta^2_{\R{halo}})$ is the central
brightness.
In addition, a random ellipticity $f_e$ and a random rotation angle
$\phi$ are applied to each of the halo images.

%%%
\ssssec{Parameters Tuning}
%%%

Our model has the following 6 parameters:
(1) fraction of the merger energy transferred into the turbulence:
$\eta_{\R{turb}} \sim \SI{10}{\percent}$;
(2) relative energy density in the magnetic field:
$\eta_B \sim \SI{0.1}{\percent}$;
(3) ratio of the total energy of injected electrons to the total thermal
energy: $\eta_e \sim \SI{0.1}{\percent}$;
(4) spectral index of the injected electrons: $s \sim \numrange{2.1}{2.5}$;
(5) efficiency of the ICM plasma instabilities:
$\zeta \sim \numrange{0.1}{0.3}$;
(6) relative energy density in the cosmic rays:
$X_{\R{CR}} \sim \SI{1}{\percent}$.
And all of them have reasonable constraints from either observational
evidences or simulation studies.

To further tune the model parameters in order to achieve better agreements
with the observations, we have collected all current observed radio halos
(\autoref{tab:halos-observed}; as of 2018 January), and compare the integrated
flux function between our simulated radio halos and the observations.
We have explored various parameter configurations,
and for each configuration we have repeated the simulation for 500 times
in order to take into account the Monte Carlo uncertainties as introduced in
Sections~\ref{sec:distributions} and \ref{sec:merging-history}.
Considering that the current observations are far from complete,
especially in the low-flux regime, our strategy was requiring that the
integrated flux function of simulations agreed with the observed one
in the high-flux regime within simulation uncertainties.
In consequence, we have chosen a set of model parameters with
$\eta_{\R{turb}} = \SI{10}{\percent}$, $\eta_B = \SI{0.1}{\percent}$,
$\eta_e = \SI{0.1}{\percent}$, $s = 2.3$,
$\zeta = 0.1$, and $X_{\R{CR}} = \SI{1.5}{\percent}$.

\subsection{Other Foreground Components}
\label{sec:fg-other}
%========================================================================

Besides the radio halos in galaxy clusters, we also simulated the maps of
several other foreground components, including the Galactic synchrotron
and free-free emissions, and the extragalactic point sources,
based on our previous work \citep[and references therein]{wang2010}.
The Galactic synchrotron map was simulated by extrapolating the
Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} all-sky map as the template to lower frequencies
with a power-law spectrum.
We have made use of the $N_{\R{side}} = 2048$ (pixel size \SI{\sim 1.72}{\arcmin})
high resolution version of the Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} map\footnote{%
  The reprocessed Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} map:
  \url{http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/cosmos/haslam_map/}.
}
reprocessed by \citet{remazeilles2015}, which had significantly better
instrument calibration and more accurate subtraction of extragalactic
sources.
And we also used the all-sky synchrotron spectral index map made by
\citet{giardino2002} to account for the index variation with sky positions.
The Galactic free-free emission was derived from the \Halpha{} survey data
\citep{finkbeiner2003}, which we corrected for dust absorption first
\citep{dickinson2003}, by employing the tight relation between the \Halpha{}
and free-free emissions due to their common origins.
And the extragalactic foreground of point sources is contributed by the
following different types of sources: star-forming and starburst galaxies,
radio-quiet AGNs, Fanaroff-Riley type I and type II AGNs, GHz-peaked
spectrum AGNs, and compact steep spectrum AGNs.

The simulated example maps at \SI{158}{\MHz} are shown in
\autoref{fig:gsyn-gff-ps-21cm}(a--c),
and the mean (r.m.s.) brightness temperatures of the Galactic synchrotron
emission, Galactic free-free emission, and extragalactic point sources
are \SI{251.4}{\kelvin} (\SI{251.7}{\kelvin}),
\SI{0.19}{\kelvin} (\SI{0.20}{\kelvin}),
and \SI{45.5}{\kelvin} (\SI{59224}{\kelvin}), respectively.

The sky maps of the EoR 21~cm signals were created using the 2016
data release from the Evolution Of 21~cm Structure project\footnote{%
  Evolution Of 21~cm Structure project:
  \url{http://homepage.sns.it/mesinger/EOS.html}},
which were generated with \texttt{21cmFAST} version 2 \citep{mesinger2011}
within a cube of 1.6 comoving \si{\Gpc} and 1024 cells along each side,
and covered a redshift range of \numrange{5.0}{86.5} \citep{mesinger2016}.
We extracted the image slices at needed frequencies (i.e., redshifts) from
the \enquote{light-cone cubes} of the recommended \enquote{faint galaxies}
case, and then tiled and re-scaled them to have the same sky coverage and
pixel size as our foreground maps.

The extracted image at \SI{158}{\MHz} is shown in
\autoref{fig:gsyn-gff-ps-21cm}(d),
and the mean (r.m.s.) brightness temperature is
\SI{9.53}{\mK} (\SI{10.69}{\mK}).

\section{Observational Simulation}
\label{sec:obs-simu}
%########################################################################

It is essential to incorporate the practical instrumental effects of
radio interferometers in order to properly evaluate the possible
contamination induced by radio halos on the EoR detection.
We therefore adopted the latest SKA1-Low layout configuration\footnote{%
  SKA1-Low Configuration Coordinates:
  \url{https://astronomers.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SKA-TEL-SKO-0000422_02_SKA1_LowConfigurationCoordinates-1.pdf}
  (released on 2016 May 21)
}
to simulate the \enquote{observed} images for the above simulated sky
maps of foreground components and EoR signal.
According to the current configuration,
the SKA1-Low interferometer consists of 512 stations, with 224 of them
randomly distributed within the \enquote{core} of \SI{1000}{\meter} in
diameter, while rest of the stations are grouped into \enquote{clusters}
and placed on 3 spiral arms extending up to a radius of
\SI{\sim 35}{\kilo\meter}.
Each station has 256 antennas randomly distributed with a minimum separation
of $d_{\R{min}} = \SI{1.5}{\meter}$ inside a circular region of
\SI{35}{\meter} in diameter \citep[e.g.,][]{mort2017}.
With this layout configuration, the dense core makes the SKA1-Low very
sensitive to the EoR signal, while the long baselines greatly help the
foreground characterization and removal, as well as other scientific goals.

We divide the \SIrange{154}{162}{\MHz} band of interest into 51
channels with a channel width of \SI{160}{\kilo\hertz}.
For each sky component, we simulate the sky maps at every frequency
channel, and then use the \texttt{OSKAR}\footnote{%
  OSKAR: \url{https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR} (version 2.7.0)}
simulator \citep{mort2010} to perform observational simulations
for \SI{6}{\hour} ($\pm \SI{3}{\hour}$ in Hour Angle) with the
SKA1-Low layout configuration.
The simulated visibility data are imaged through the
\texttt{WSClean}\footnote{%
  WSClean: \url{https://sourceforge.net/p/wsclean} (version 2.5)}
imager \citep{offringa2014} using Briggs' weighting with
robustness of 0 \citep{briggs1995},
and the created images are cropped to keep only the central
\SI{4 x 4}{\deg} regions for use in subsequent analyses.

Considering that the Galactic free-free emission is much weaker
than the Galactic synchrotron radiation, and both of them have
similar diffuse structures, we then combine these two components
for the observational simulation.
As for the extragalactic point sources, we assume that the brightest
ones with \SI{158}{\MHz} flux density $S > \SI{10}{\mJy}$ \TODO{check}
are correctly removed \citep[e.g.,][]{pindor2011}.
Finally, we obtain the \enquote{observed} images of the Galactic
diffuse emission (the synchrotron radiation combined with the
free-free emission), the extragalactic point sources (with the
brightest ones removed), the radio halos, and the EoR signal.

    Take the above simulated image cube, subtract the spectral-smooth
    foregrounds fitting a smooth polynomial along the frequency axis,
    evaluate the loss of EoR signals (use image-domain indexes???
    can also use the total power spectrum???)

    May consider two cases: (1) only radio halos is superimposed onto the
    EoR signals; (2) radio halos as well as Galactic foregrounds are
    added to the EoR signals.

  \item[Power spectrum]
    Take the above simulated image cube, calculate the 2D
    (i.e., cylindrically averaged) power spectrum, evaluate the foregrounds
    contamination within the (theoretically predicted) EoR window,
    compare to the case that only EoR signals exist in the EoR windows.
\end{description}


%% TODO: future works/improvements:
One of the main purposes of our foregrounds simulation is to support
the development and evaluation of foregrounds removal or separation
methods in our forthcoming works.
We will combine our foregrounds simulation with interferometric
observational simulation, to generate the \enquote{observed} visibility
data as well as images (e.g., by using the \textsc{clean} algorithm).
In this way, we incorporate the realistic instrumental effects into
our simulation pipeline, making our developed methods more versatile
and prepare for future real observations.

In addition to the foregrounds removal aiming at the EoR signal
detection, the methods to effectively identify and extract the faint
extended radio emissions (e.g., halos, relics) from observation images
is of the same importance.
With future more sensitive observations combined with a better detection
method, we are able to build a big sample of galaxy clusters, which
may provide us with plenty of opportunities to study them in the radio
regime.

Moreover, there is still much room to improve the current foregrounds
simulation, e.g., taking radio relics into account, more realistic
source morphologies by utilizing the deep learning techniques,
full polarization support.
We will continue to improve our foregrounds simulation works and make
them available in our public software \texttt{FG21sim} in the future.

In addition, galaxy clusters are also important objects of study in their
own right:
\begin{itemize}
  \item elements to form the large-scale structures, key to understand the
    structure formation and evolution of the Universe;
  \item merger-induced turbulence and shocks accelerate electrons to produce
    extended halos and relics, respectively, enable us to trace cluster
    mergers and formations with radio techniques;
  \item great laboratory to study the origin of cosmic rays, particle
    acceleration, magnetic growth and distribution, etc.
\end{itemize}

Due to their low surface brightness and steep spectra, these extended
radio emissions from galaxy clusters are difficult to find at middle-
or high-frequency ranges (e.g., \SI{1.4}{\GHz}).
However, they become much brighter and thus easier to be detected in
the low-frequency radio band.  The large field of view (FoV) of the
low-frequency interferometer also helps discover them more efficiently.
Owing to its excellent sensitivity, the SKA will possibly discover more
than several thousands of halos and relics, providing us with invaluable
data to understand and solve the puzzles with regard to galaxy clusters.
Furthermore, the faint radio sky can be very different, and we may have
unexpected findings as we go deeper \citep{padovani2016rev,herreraRuiz2017}.

In a flat \lcdm{} cosmology, the critical linear overdensity as a function
of redshift $z$ is \citep{kitayama1996,randall2002}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-crit}
  \delta_c(z) = \frac{D(z=0)}{D(z)}
  \left[ \frac{3 (12\pi)^{2/3}}{20} \right]
  \left[1 + 0.0123 \log_{10} \Omega_f(z) \right],
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_f(z)$ is the mass density ratio at redshift $z$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:omega-fz}
  \Omega_f(z) = \frac{\Omega_m(1+z)^3}{\Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda}},
\end{equation}
and $D(z)$ is the growth factor given by
\citep[Equation~(13.6)]{peebles1980}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:growth-factor}
  D(x) = \frac{(x^3 + 2)^{1/2}}{x^{3/2}}
    \int_0^x y^{3/2} (y^3 + 2)^{-3/2} \,\D{y},
\end{equation}
with $x_0 \equiv (2\Omega_{\Lambda}/\Omega_m)^{1/3}$ and
$x = x_0 / (1+z)$.

The virial radius of a cluster is:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:radius-virial}
  R_{\R{vir}} = \left[
    \frac{3 M_{\R{vir}}}{4\pi \Delta_{\R{vir}}(z) \rho_{\R{crit}}(z)}
  \right]^{1/3},
\end{equation}
where $M_{\R{vir}}$ is the virial mass (can also be regarded as
the total mass) of the cluster,
$\rho_{\R{crit}}(z)$ is the critical density at redshift $z$,
and $\Delta_{\R{vir}}(z)$ is the average overdensity of the cluster
at redshift $z$ given by \citep{kitayama1996,cassano2005}:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:delta-vir}
  \Delta_{\R{vir}}(z) = 18\pi^2 \left[ 1 + 0.4093 \, w(z)^{0.9052} \right],
\end{equation}
where $w(z) \equiv \Omega_f^{-1}(z) - 1$.

In a flat \lcdm{} cosmology as we adopted, the age of the Universe
at redshift $z$ takes an analytical form
\citep[their Equation~(18)]{thomas2000}:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:universe-age}
  t(z; \Omega_m, \Omega_{\Lambda}=1-\Omega_m)
    & = \frac{1}{H_0} \int_z^{\infty}
      \frac{\D{z'}}{(1+z')\sqrt{1 + \Omega_m z' (3+3z'+z'^2)}} \nonumber \\
    & = \frac{2}{3 H_0 \sqrt{1-\Omega_m}} \sinh^{-1} \!\left(
      \sqrt{\frac{\Omega_m^{-1} - 1}{(1+z)^3}} \right).
\end{align}
