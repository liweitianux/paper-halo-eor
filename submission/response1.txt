Authors' Responses
------------------

We gratefully thank the reviewer for the constructive comments that greatly
help improve this manuscript.  Based on the comments, we have significantly
improved the modeling of radio halos (Section 2.1.3), including more
reasonable relations for the turbulence region radius (r_turb) and for
the radio halo radius (r_halo), refined calculations of the turbulence
velocity dispersion and the diffusion coefficient, formation identification
of radio halos, and other small improvements.  We have extensively revised
the manuscript to describe our modeling and results more thoroughly and
clearly.  The original Section 2.1.3 has been split into five subsections
in order to give a more coherent description.  All the suggested
intermediate results (e.g., cluster mass and redshift distributions,
simulated merging histories, temporal evolution of the electron and
synchrotron emission spectra) and additional scaling relations (e.g., radio
halo fraction -- cluster mass, radio halo power at 1.4 GHz -- cluster mass)
have been carefully reconsidered and presented in the revised manuscript.

With the improved modeling of radio halos and the tuned parameters, our
model can well reproduce the observed scaling relation between radio halo
power at 1.4 GHz and cluster mass (Cassano et al. 2013).  Moreover, the
obtained 1.4 GHz flux function matches the observed one as well as the
prediction of Cassano et al. (2012), as shown in Figure 5.

We have rerun all the simulations for radio halos and updated the figures,
tables, and relevant text throughout the manuscript.  We note that the
results of evaluating the contamination of radio halos on the EoR detection
do not change significantly, because the major part of the contamination is
contributed by bright radio halos, which are reasonably constrained by the
observed 1.4 GHz flux function.

The changes to the manuscript are highlighted in "cyan."

Response 1:

We now acknowledge the two works (Brunetti et al. 2001, MNRAS, 320, 365;
Petrosian 2001, ApJ, 557, 560) in the first paragraph of Section 2.1, where
we have also added one sentence to briefly introduce the turbulent
re-acceleration model.

Response 2:

In this new version of the manuscript, we have provided the following
necessary intermediate results in Section 2.1, in order to make our
modeling of radio halos easier to follow and understand.

(a) In Section 2.1.1, we mention the number of galaxy clusters with mass
M >= 2e14 Msun and redshift z <= 4 in a sky patch of size 10x10 deg^2
is 504, as determined by the Press-Schechter mass function.  Meanwhile, we
have added Figure 1 to show the mass and redshift histograms.

(b) In Section 2.1.2, we have added Figure 2 to demonstrate: (i) merger
trees for one galaxy cluster of mass 1e15 Msun obtained by repeating the
random build process for 30 times; (ii) simulated merger trees for 30
galaxy clusters randomly drawn from the sample constructed in Section
2.1.1.

(c) In Section 2.1.4, we have added Figure 3 to illustrate the temporal
evolution of the electron and synchrotron emission spectra for an example
cluster with one major merger, which begins at redshift z = 0.3 (t = 10.3
Gyr) and is tracked until z = 0.15 (t = 11.8 Gyr).  In addition, we show
the temporal variation of synchrotron emissivity at 158 MHz and 1.4 GHz in
panel (c) and the corresponding spectral indices in panel (d).  See also
Response 5.

Response 3a:

We agree with the reviewer and have proposed a more appropriate relation
for the radius of turbulence regions generated by mergers.  As described
in Section 2.1.3/d, the turbulence region radius is estimated to be:
r_turb = r_s + r_{c,m} ,
where r_s is the stripping radius of the infalling sub-cluster, and
r_{c,m} = 0.1 r_{vir,m} is the core radius of the main cluster.  This new
assumption gives r_turb ~ 1-3 r_{c,m} and is consistent with previous
simulation studies (e.g., Vazza et al. 2011, 2012; Miniati & Beresnyak
2015).  We note that minor mergers can also generate a relatively large
turbulence region of radius about r_{c,m} due to the core gas sloshing
induced by the sub-cluster (e.g., Vazza et al. 2012), but the generated
turbulence is rather weak because of the less injected energy
[see Equation (23)].

Response 3b:

In Section 2.1.5 of this revised manuscript, we have updated the relation
for estimating the radius of radio halos to be:
r_halo = f_r R_turb (r_vir / r_{vir,*})^b ,
where R_turb is the radius of the largest turbulence region, r_vir is the
cluster's virial radius, r_{vir,*} is the virial radius of a reference
cluster of mass 1e15 Msun, and f_r and b are the scaling normalization and
slope, respectively.  By comparing with the observed scaling relation of
r_halo ~ r_vir^{2.63+/-0.50} (Cassano et al. 2007), we obtain f_r = 0.7
and b = 1.8.

Response 4:

In this revised manuscript, we have included the suggested statistical
connections between radio halos and hosting clusters in Section 2.1.6.
First, we have incorporated the observed scaling relation between the radio
halo power at 1.4 GHz (P_1400) and the cluster mass (M_vir) in the tuning
of model parameters.  Combined with the 1.4 GHz flux function of currently
observed radio halos, we have tuned the model parameters.  The tuned model
produces a scaling relation of P_1400 ~ M_vir^{3.94+/-0.12}, which agrees
well with the observed one (P_1400 ~ M_500^{3.70+/-0.56}) obtained by
Cassano et al. (2013) on both the slope and the normalization, although the
simulated results exhibit a somewhat larger scatter (see Figure 4).

Secondly, we have added Figure 6 to show the fraction of clusters with
radio halos as a function of the cluster mass.  In accordance with previous
studies (e.g., Cassano et al. 2006, 2012), it clearly shows that massive
clusters tend to have higher probabilities to host radio halos and that
clusters are much more likely to host radio halos visible at low
frequencies (~100-200 MHz).

Response 5:

In the previous version of this manuscript, we made the simplification that
every cluster with past or ongoing mergers hosts a radio halo, which may
have faded out if there is no very recent or ongoing turbulent
acceleration.  All of these radio halos were counted in the calculation of
flux functions, which led to the overestimation at the low-flux end.

In this revised version, we first identify the radio halos that are
actually existing at frequency \nu and only use these radio halos to derive
the flux function at that frequency.  As describe in Section 2.1.5, a radio
halo is regarded as existing at frequency \nu based on the following two
criteria:
(1) the synchrotron emissivity J(\nu) of the final electron spectrum
n_e(\gamma, t_sim) is at least 1000 times larger than the emissivity
J'(\nu) of the reference electron spectrum n'_e(\gamma, t_sim), which is
obtained by solving the same Fokker-Planck equation but without
merger-induced turbulent acceleration;
(2) the spectral index at frequency \nu is not steeper than 3.
We present in Figure 3(c,d) an example of identifying the radio halo at
1.4 GHz and 158 MHz.  As shown in Figure 5, the newly derived flux
functions flatten at low-flux end.  In addition, our 1.4 GHz flux function
agrees with the prediction of Cassano et al. (2012).

We identify radio halos at 158 MHz separately from at 1.4 GHz.  Since radio
halos at low frequencies could be generated by less intense mergers (Figure
6) and have longer lifetimes (e.g., Figure 3(c,d)), their number counts are
much larger, which makes the flux function of low-frequency radio halos
higher than that of high-frequency radio halos, as illustrated in Figure 5.

Response 6:

We now refer to our modeling and simulation of radio halos as a
"semi-analytic approach" throughout the new manuscript.

Response 7:

We have modified this sentence to read as "Since currently no reasonable
constraints on these parameters can be obtained from either observational
or theoretical studies, it is necessary to tune them to make the model
predictions consistent with observations."  This sentence now locates in
the first paragraph of Section 2.1.6.
