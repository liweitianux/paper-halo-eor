Authors' Responses
------------------

We gratefully thank the reviewer for the constructive comments that greatly
help improve this manuscript.  Based on the comments, we have significantly
improved the modeling of radio halos (Section 2.1.3), including more
physically motivated relations for the radius of turbulence regions
(r_turb) and for the radio halo radius (r_halo), refined calculations of
the turbulence velocity dispersion and the diffusion coefficient, existence
identification of radio halos, and other small improvements.  We have
extensively revised the manuscript to describe our modeling and results
more thoroughly and clearly.  The original Section 2.1.3 has been split
into multiple logical subsections to give a more coherent description.  All
the suggested intermediate results (e.g., cluster mass and redshift
distributions, simulated merging histories, temporal evolution of the
electron and synchrotron emission spectra) and additional scaling relations
(e.g., radio halo fraction vs. cluster mass, radio halo power at 1.4 GHz
vs. cluster mass) have been carefully considered and incorporated.

With the improved modeling of radio halos and the tuned parameters, our
model can well reproduce the observed scaling relation between radio halo
power at 1.4 GHz and cluster mass (Cassano et al. 2013). Moreover, the
obtained 1.4 GHz flux function matches the observed one as well as the
prediction by Cassano et al. (2012).

We have rerun all the simulations for radio halos and updated the figures
and results throughout the manuscript.  We note that the results of
evaluating the contamination of radio halos on the EoR detection do not
change significantly, because the major part of the contamination is
contributed by bright radio halos, which are well constrained by the
observed 1.4 GHz flux function.

The changes to the manuscript are highlighted in "cyan."

We now acknowledge the two works (Brunetti et al. 2001, MNRAS, 320, 365;
Petrosian 2001, ApJ, 557, 560) in the first paragraph of Section 2.1.

Response 2:

In this new version of the manuscript, we present in Section 2.1 the
following necessary intermediate results that make our modeling of radio
halos easier to follow and understand.

(a) In Section 2.1.1, we mention the number of galaxy clusters with mass M
>= 2e14 Msun and redshift z <= 4 in a sky patch of size 10x10 deg^2 is 504,
as determined by the Press-Schechter mass function.  Meanwhile, we have
added Figure 1 showing the mass and redshift histograms.

(b) In Section 2.1.2, we have added Figure 2 showing: (i) 30 randomly built
merger trees for a galaxy cluster of mass 1e15 Msun at redshift 0.5; (ii)
the simulated merger trees for 30 galaxy clusters randomly drawn from the
sample constructed in Section 2.1.1.

(c) In Section 2.1.4, we have added Figure 3 to illustrate the temporal
evolution of the electron and synchrotron emission spectra for an example
cluster of mass 1e15 Msun that merges with a sub-cluster of mass 5e14 Msun
at redshift 0.3.  In addition, we show the evolution of synchrotron
emissivity at 158 MHz and 1400 MHz with time from 10.3 to 12.4 Gyr in panel
(c) of Figure 3, where we also mark the radio halo existing periods at each
frequency (see also Response 5).

Response 3a:

We agree with the reviewer and have proposed a more physically motivated
relation for the radius of turbulence regions generated by mergers.  As
described in Section 2.1.3/d, the radius of the turbulence region is
estimated to be:
r_turb = r_s + r_c,m,
where r_s is the stripping radius of the infalling sub-cluster, and
r_c,m = 0.1 r_vir,m is the core radius of the main cluster.  This
assumption is based on previous simulation studies: major mergers can
generate intense turbulence in regions of radius about 0.3-0.5 r_vir,m
(e.g., Sunyaev et al.  2003; Miniati & Beresnyak 2015), and minor mergers
can also cause relatively large-scale turbulence in regions of radius
about r_c,m due to gas sloshing and other mechanisms induced by the
sub-cluster (e.g., Vazza et al. 2011, 2012).

>   $) Related to point 3), the assumption that the size of radio halos

>   assumption.

Response 3b:

In Section 2.1.5 of this revised manuscript, we have updated the estimation
of the radius of radio halos to be:
r_halo = f_r R_turb ((r_vir / r_vir,*)^b,
where R_turb is the maximum radius of the turbulence regions generated by
all mergers, r_vir is the cluster virial radius, r_vir,* is the virial
radius of a cluster of mass 1e15 Msun, and f_r and b are the scaling
normalization and slope, respectively.  By comparing with the observed
scaling relation of r_halo ~ r_vir^{2.63+/-0.50} (Cassano et al.  2007),
we adopt f_r = 0.7 and b = 1.8, which can give a relation of
r_halo ~ r_vir^{2.67+/-0.02} that agrees well with the observed one
(see Figure 4).

Response 4:

In this revised manuscript, we have included the suggested statistical
connections between radio halos and hosting clusters in Section 2.1.6.
First, we have incorporated the observed scaling relation between the radio
halo power at 1.4 GHz (P_1400) and the cluster mass (M_vir) in the tuning
of model parameters.  Combined with the 1.4 GHz flux function of currently
observed radio halos, we have tuned the model parameters.  The tuned model
produces a scaling relation of P_1400 ~ M_vir^{3.94+/-0.12}, which agrees
well with the observed one (P_1400 ~ M_500^{3.70+/-0.56}) obtained by
Cassano et al. (2013) on both the slope and the normalization, although the
simulated results exhibit a somewhat larger scattering (see Figure 5).

Secondly, we have added Figure 7 showing the fraction of clusters with
radio halos as a function of the cluster mass.  In accordance with previous
studies (e.g., Cassano et al. 2006; Cassano et al. 2012), it clearly shows
that more massive clusters have higher probabilities to host radio halos
and that clusters are much more likely to host radio halos visible at low
frequencies.

Response 5:

In the previous version of this manuscript, we made the simplification that
every cluster with past or ongoing mergers hosts a radio halo, which may
have faded out if there is no very recent or ongoing turbulence
acceleration.  All of these radio halos were counted in deriving the flux
functions, which led to the overestimation at the low-flux end.

In this revised version, we first identify the radio halos that are
actually existing at frequency \nu and only use these radio halos to derive
the flux function at that frequency.  As describe in Section 2.1.5, a radio
halo is regarded as existing at frequency \nu if its synchrotron emissivity
J(\nu) of the final electron spectrum n_e(\gamma, t_sim) is at least 1000
times larger than that of the reference electron spectrum n’_e(\gamma,
t_sim), which is obtained by solving the same Fokker-Planck equation but
without merger-induced turbulent acceleration (see Figure 3(c) for an
example).  As shown in Figure 6, the newly derived flux functions flatten
at low-flux end.  In addition, our 1.4 GHz flux function agrees with the
prediction by Cassano et al. (2012).

We identify radio halos at 158 MHz separately from at 1.4 GHz.  Since radio
halos at low frequencies could be generated by less intense mergers and
have longer lifetimes (Figure 3(c)), their number counts are much larger,
which makes the flux function of low-frequency radio halos higher than that
of high-frequency radio halos.

Response 6:

We now refer to our modeling and simulation of radio halos as a
"semi-analytic approach" throughout the new manuscript.

Response 7:

We have modified this sentence to read as "Since these parameters are
currently lacking reasonable constraints from either observation or
simulation studies, it is essential to tune them for the purpose of
achieving good agreement with observations."  This sentence now locates
in the first paragraph of Section 2.1.6.
